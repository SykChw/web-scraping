Improved latency in Samsung Notes makes every pen stroke feel as natural as ink on paper — and you can convert those hastily written ideas into legible text.
5G Ready powered by Galaxy’s first 4nm processor. Our fastest, most powerful chip ever. That means, a faster CPU and GPU compared to Galaxy S21 Ultra. It’s an epic leap for smartphone technology.
The Dynamic AMOLED 2x display improves outdoor visibility with up to 1750 nits in peak brightness.* And the 120Hz adaptive refresh rate keeps the scroll smooth, adjusting to what's on screen for an optimized view.
Our most advanced Pro-grade Camera yet, packing the power of a professional's kit in one handheld device. Also lets you make your nights epic with Nightography: The sensor pulls in more light, the Super Clear Lens tones down lens flare, and fast-acting AI delivers near-instant intelligent processing.
