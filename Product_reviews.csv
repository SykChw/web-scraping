READ before BUY ! ""Iphone 12! Worth buying or not?""
","
From owner POV, It's completely different experience for me as I've come from a long line of android platform. But the UI is very attractive. I think it surpassed my expectations as a consumer. But as a rational thinker, 79k is a lot for a phone which carry a little amount of specs ships. I'm lucky that I have a Amazon business account, so getting a GST bill.As per the limitations :1. 60 Hz display (with the beautiful UI animations, it doesn't feel like one)2. Google exceeds on Maps, contacts and AI capabilities.3. Hefty price tag. (I mean! Wtf is this! 80k! Are you serious?)4. Necessity of a 1900 INR charger (That too of 20W and without extra cable. Why?)5. One sillicon case worth 4600 INR ( Sorry! My name's not Sanjib 'Ambani' ! Terrible joke! I know! I left my sarcasm capabilities at an Apple store for leverage.)Advantages:1. It's a flagship iPhone 12 with A14 bionic processor and it's best in the market.2. The UI and the optimization (And I came from an Android background.)3. Display (Can't find much difference if you're a Samsung flagship user.)4. The design and in-hand feel.5. The build quality, you can feel by holding it that it's premium.Overall, I found it very attractive and worthy of the money spent. (Because I am telling my mind this only as justification for a 80k expenditure)On a serious note, as coming from an Android background, if Samsung could launch a flagship with Snapdragon latest processor, I could think of buying that.But iPhone 12 in 2020?  its a technological wonder. It's very slim, premium and beautiful.If you're comfortable to spend 80k, you should go for it for a wonderful experience.

An overall good premium experience
","
SUMMERY: As a first time iPhone user, I would say one should definitely buy iPhone ONLY for premium built & premium hardware (will talk later) while the whole iOS experience is pretty overrated. iPhones isn't any exceptionally fast with normal apps like YouTube, Insta etc, Android phones are equally snappy with them in 2022.PROS:1. Impressive hardware, the heptics, the autobrightness & otherwise highly ignored things in Android are way too perfectly executed in iPhone and it DOES make a big difference in user experience!!2. The screen is AMAZING.. it doesn't have 90 or 120 hz refresh rate but it FEELS better than my Nord with 90 hz!!3. A14 bionic promises years of performance ahead.4. Battery life is somewhere in between good & great.5.6. The dimensions of phone, it's smaller than usual android phones and feels much more handy along with less weight.7. Overall build quality is great.8. Best audio output out there.9. Long term support.CONS:1. SLOW CHARGING. 20 W only, you'll be jealous of 1/3rd price phones with 60 W charging. Yes that much high charging will effect health of battery but 20 W is way way too less, if Apple is such a legendary company they should have created a battery that can withstand decently fast charging while instead they just use slow charging to keep their battery's health.2. Overy exhagerated software experience, reality is that Android is more user friendly with better gesture & commonsense options & settings & steps to do simple things. iOS looks pretty yes but UX engineers at Apple have really done a crappy job.. there's still no notification grouping in correct manner (its executed poorly), no proper homescreen customisation & just so so so many ""commonsense"" things are missing from iOS I can rant all day about it. Everything you can do in Android with a single click or swipe takes 2 swipes and then a click to do in iOS its SOOOOO ANNOYING. Like you want to clear a notification? Swipe and then click on clear. You want to open a notification? Swipe FIRST and then click open.. like wth????????3. DON'T believe Apple fanboys who scream about speed, Android phones are equally snappy in performance today. There are split second app loading times in iOS also, just like in Android. And yeah iOS DOES HAVE occasional bugs too, apps taking too much time sometimes etc etc.4. FaceID is nice but an in-fingerprint reader seems the best ID to me atleast, that's missing.5. Ridiculously expensive accessories6. Battery life is above good but not great.In the end I would say iPhone, overall, does provide a better experience (mostly cuz of hardware only) but it's expensive. Do know that you're NOT buying a value-for-money phone at all, so buy it only if you can afford it without much difficulty.

I prefer the 11 or the 12 mini
","
I have been an apple user for the past 10 years and this is the first phone which is disappointing. I was using the Xr and 11 before this and though of upgrading.1. If you are moving from an android to iPhone for the 1st time, its a great phone to get in terms of camera, processor, screen quality. But if you are already an existing iPhone user, upgrade only from XR downwards. That is if your are upgrading from a 8/X/XS/XR. If you have a 11, stick to it. Wait for the 13 or budget is not a constraint then get the 12 pro.2. form factor. Apple has gone back to rectangle brick design that they used in their earlier phones. Now for me this was one the reasons I didn't like the phone. It wasn't comfortable n the hand after being used to the curve of the X and 11 and XR3. Camera- best camera quality with night mode . u can't go wrong with this camera setup.4. screen- excellent screen quality , no complaints here.5. 5g - IS it really that big a deal breaker ? especially if you are in India where 5g seems a long way off.6. No charging adapter. You either have to connect it to your MacBook or buy a separate power adapter. When ur spending 70 odd grand, that's the least apple could offer.7. again no ear phones.8. It somehow doesn't have the wow factor as what the X had.Update.I exchange my phone for a 12 mini. much more easier to use with one hand and comfortable.

iPhone is like a Shadi ka Ladoo
","
I was an Android user and had high hopes with this Apple gadget, however after 8 months of using this so hyped Apple device, I can finally say that an iPhone is similar to a Shadi ka ladoo — jo Khaaye wo pachtaaye aur jo na khaye wo bhi pachtaaye. The reason I am saying this is because this phone lacks even the most basic features that even a 5k android phone has, like - call recording - which I eventually realised that it should have been an Apple feature instead of third party apps - which demand money and are pretty inconvenient to use.The second drawback is that call logs are auto erased and kept up to a certain stack size (100 / 102) and if you want to go back to pull any earlier call logs beyond this specified stack size, you won’t be able to do so and will have to rely on your network provider (if you are eligible) for the same.These are two very ground level use cases that fail to deliver in an Apple device and since I faced real life situations surrounding these two scenarios I feel that I it is not worth having this Phone and better to keep your “Android” pants on.Then I thought why I bought this phone in the first place and got my answer - 1. Camera ??Android phones are easily  competing nicely with iPhone Camera now-a-days and some have even better camera.2. Brand marketing / re-selling value / durability ?? I am so over it now after 8 months of usage and the price keeps on sinking down as newer model enters the market so not a wise call I must sayFinal outcome:Definitely not a returning customer.

I was an android user before using iPhone. So that this is my first experience handling with iOS.As an android user I felt little bit difficult while using iOS but later you would love it.Performance of this phone is awesome and outstanding. Photo and video quality, sound quality, connectivity etc all is good.I experienced the heating issue while charging and phone calls. But the coolant system is good, it will cool down quickly.Overall it’s a good phone.

Those who already use iPhone, no need of explanation.Coming to specific model iPhone 12 …Most of the features are same as IPhone 12 Pro, like -->1.  6.1 inch Super Retina XDR display  (OLED display), with 2532x1170-pixel resolution at 460 ppi2.  A14 bionic Chip & Next-generation Neural Engine3.  Dual 12MP camera system (Ultra Wide and Wide)4.  5G, Ceramic Shield front, Compatible with MagSafe, True tone, Haptic Touch ….Those who are not bothered about LiDAR, Telephoto mode, Apple ProRAW, stainless steel frame and wants to save around 30K bucks should go with iPhone 12. If those things matter you most then go for iPhone 12 Pro with additional 30K bucks.By the way, aerospace-grade aluminum frame in iPhone 12 looks stunning. I am very much happy with iPhone 12.

Switched from S20FE ( S865). Not worth it. Only switched for the size.Never expected iPhones to be so buggy. The screen just pauses in some apps.

One of the best device. Performance Is Just Awesome. A True Flagship. Camera Performance Is Also Just Awesome. The Only Problem I Have With This Device Is .,... That its portrait photos are not that much good. Because due to the lack of telephoto lense. And Front Camera Is Also Good. But the same issue I'm facing here too.. The portrait mode is not so good. The only thing I am disappointed is its Portrait Mode On both the back and front camera. The rest of functions and performance are just awesome.

Got it for around 67500 and it’s awesome. I used 6s before and transitioning to this was pretty good.

Apple has dropped ear phone and charger  adapter from pack. Charger adapter are required for first time users.

Firstly it’s thin, weight is reduced. Apple changed the display to Super Retina edge-to-edge OLED now. It features Ceramic Shield to protect from hardest falls and drops. You are definitely going to love the edges this time. A good option to upgrade from previous models.

Looks attractive &Excellent battery lifeSmooth softwareVery Nice mobile. Power will further comes in action once 5G Signals made available. Smart look . Smart speed. Smart snaps. Happy to share.The phone, surprisingly, has a good-quality build for its price. It is still using a plastic frame and a plastic back although the latter is more “glasstic” which is a term used for plastic panels with a glass-like finish to them. The panel is matte and shiny which relieves it from attracting smudges and fingerprint marks on the panel. It makes for a great feature since wiping the back panel for smudges if it had stuck would’ve been a constant hassle.

The Dimensity 700 processor used in this is very good for gaming and processor intensive tasks and is the main highlight. Phone is well built and is good value money for a 5g phone and comes with a fast charger.Cons. The earlier designs which had the finger print sensor at the rear were better as you only had to touch it and not press it to unlock. Fast charging is good but it's fullest potential can be reliazed only in cold climates as the charging speed is reduced as the battery gets warmer to protect battery. The screen is not very bright but okay for indoor use.

Please do not buy expensive product like iphone from Amazon, i had very bad exp, the charger cord was missing and had sound quality issues. Amazon initial told charger doesn't come in box and when i challenged it they asked reimburse the cord amount, but i requested a replacement, after some days they called me and informed that they dont take responsibility of missing items, and 10 day replacement policy they dont follow, you can read the email conversation attached  here where i mentioned every thing, i have the call recordings as well. At last they denied the phone replacement and even to provide the missing cord. For any damage or quality issues they said amazon is not responsible.

Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren’t working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren’t working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don’t regret after.

The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.

iPhone XR with better Camera and Internals
","
This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!Now, off to the device.ProsThe device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal.Speakers sound better than my previous phone.A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.ConsRemember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.

This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes.But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy.1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget.2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS.Now I want to share my 2 month experience with iPhone 11.1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week.2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion.3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max.4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max.5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing.6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie. That's it. Should provide Fast Charging.

I bought the iPhone 11 64gb red and I absolutely love it. The design is insanely good.Lot of reviews say that they received a damaged phone but that is simply not true!!The truth is the phone comes with an outdated iOS and you must update it. Or else your camera won’t be running normally or the video quality won’t be more than 360p( as it was in my case). But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed.Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there’a a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing. ( The software update took care of that too and I don’t know how).So don’t worry about buying a iPhone here. A lot of them are freaking out that their phones aren’t functioning properly and they were too quick to write a bad review. Truth is a software update fixes all these people’s complaints.

My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV.

Amazon now claiming that I have not opted for any emi option and asking me whether I took any screenshot while making payment. Such an unprofessional behaviourNow come to the phone-Everything is awesome except whenever you make call or incoming calls the network for that number dies and quality of call is terrible .

If you are an Android user who wants to move to iOS, then this is the best iPhone you can get without spending unnecessary huge amount on pro versions.I myself would have preferred OLED displays over LCD display on iPhone 11 but I just bought the iPhone 11. Trust me the display is very very good on this phone & with all the same chipset as the pro versions, there's really not much that you are losing.You won't regret this purchase if you want to start using iOS! Everything is very fluid & I like it a lot!! Don't think will be moving to Android in future.

Beast with a limp

Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone’s features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a “Liquid Retina display”; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won’t notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ₹, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the “budget” phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79₹ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase “it just works” really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn’t too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It’s safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the “soli” chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It’s Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won’t say too much on this topic as it’s well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it’s hardware.

The iphone 11 is a good phone every thing is fine but in this budget all the phones are better than it. The main problem is the battery it is long if you dont play any games , if you use the phone for using social media and camera you can go for it .But ya another problem is the refresh rate if you dont know refresh rate it is screen smoothness . it has 60 hz of refresh rate and all the phones in budget have 120 hz to 144 hz . And the build quality is good but if it one times fall from your hand it is gone . Even from a small distance you can get small visual small cracks

Best thing that money can buy

Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11. Go for it guys. Haters will always hate!

I have switched from iPhone 8plus to iPhone 11 and I must say I am really impressed and speechless I can't ask more than this.1 - Best Lcd you won't disappoint  I am myself product designer and pixel pepper display plays a very important role but am really impressed with this display.2 - Size of the phone is perfect not to big not to small and I am guessing loads people may be concerned about that big bezel or notch compare to iPhone 11 pro or 11 pro max after using for a while you don't even realize about that.3 - Everythings looks so good in this phone using the app in this phone is a completely different experience if you come up from old iPhone with big bezels4- Face ID is just one of the best features. Loads people still cry about touch id not there but they are so wrong.Face ID is so fast and so cool I am just loving it.5- Camera Kills all the flagship android phone. What amazing photos you can click with this phone night mode is the rockstar.So Bottomline whoever is thinking to buy this phone just go for it you won't regret

Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..Update: phone is working good the way i use it my phone is still at 100% capacity.. daily avg use is 2:30hrs to 4:15hrsI have not installed any google apps at all. And no streaming appsOnly work and paytm and banking appsWith social media apps excluding facebookUpdate #2 it is almost a year now and my bettery health is still at 100%. i charge at 30% and till 82-86%no fb snapchat or any google app. PEACE.Update #3 1year 6+months battery health at 97% because i was using mobile data in outside weather condition feels a bit heated at times but its because of the ios update but doing fine.

New iPhone received today with dead battery!

Ordered for iPhone 11 and received the very next day. When tried to switch on the phone, it did not work. Tried out it on charge and figured it had 0% battery charge! Normally it happens when there is a problem with battery or the phone which drains out charge even though it's switched off! Immediately notified Amazon and demanded refund/ replacement! Then we figured you can't get refund for Apple products on Amazon. However if the product is faulty, they will try fixing it or replace. Have not set up the phone yet as people suggested not to do that, else there may be further trouble returning the product. Confusing suggestions from customer care team, technical team etc. Suggestions: Never ever buy premium products, specially Apple products on Amazon. Will put together the whole experience once we know what's happening and share details.

The best decision of my life
","
From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not.

Not a great phone

The touch is intermittent...sometimes great... sometimes doesn’t respond. Heavy. Network receiver not working properly. What else to say... feeling cheated....After one month.....Now it’s been over a month since I have been using it and I feel that it’s the worst product from Apple. I don’t know what’s the reason but even after two updates, I feel that the touch is not working well and it keeps hanging on. The camera is not very wow but works well (looking at the price it’s not something really great...this much is expected at least). Also, the Face ID doesn’t work most of the times. And it takes more than 5 seconds to realise that it now needs to show up the regular pin/pattern to unlock. Even otherwise, I personally don’t find Face ID to be successful. To be true my four year old nephew finds it really easy to open this as he would keep my phone ready to capture my attention and would say something that would lead me to look at the phone unknowingly.

Read this before switching from Android
","
If are switching from Android here are the following things that will frustrate you in apple:1. Video recording doesnt have pause button2. Almost every app needs paid licence. Eg A proper pdf viewer3. Cant save files on a folder and use it in explorer.4. Settings of each app can only be accessed via settings and not the individual app. So eg if you are in camera app, need to change resolution, need to come out of it and change it in settings5. There is no select all button in most apps like messaging, gmail, gallery etc. happy ticking off each item6. Face id has this eventually annoying animation that cant be turned off.7. If you prefer call recording, it takes a periodically paid app to place a background conference call and record at its end to show your recorded calls8. The otg adapter is over 500 times more expensive than android otg adaptor.9. Similarly all accessories are more expensive than their value. They just provide a snob effect10. Sometimes you would wonder how to get to the previous screen without reaching to the far top left back button on screen. But dont worry there isnt and the gestures dont work. Eg open a product image on flipkart or amazon and try to close it. Will take some time to figure it out.11. Display resolution is nowhere close to the similar price ranged android phones12. The new back tap feature to take a screenshot etc often gets triggered when you keep the phone on a desk13. There is no keyboard that shows numbers on the top line. So we have to swap no. And letter keys. Imagine entering an alphanumeric captcha14. Cant have a blank home screen to highlight wallpaper15. No battery % on the notification bar16. If you have old mp3 songs, they cant be simply beamed from your old android to iphone, need to attach phone to a computer and import via itunes.17. And dont get me started on connecting to other phones, via bluetooth or nfc. Even if you some manage to get a file on iphone, theres a good chance itll be useless. I wanted to import contacts using vcf backups. Security that puts shackles on you own feet.18. Try changing iphone ringtone to your downloaded tune. Not possible unless we use a thirdparty app.19. Cant even select all text from a page with a single click. What is with you people and select all?But hey. I get to show off my new iphone 🤬

I purchased the iPhone 11 for my daughter. She was very keen to have her own iPhone. On 20 oct 2020, after receiving the package I opened it and switched on the iPhone. It was devastating for us, my daughter in particular to see a red spot in the screen. Immediately I took up with Amazon help. But they disowned on the pretext that Apple, the manufacturer can only help on this. I contacted Apple help but they tried to shift the responsibility to seller. We were put in a state of helplessness. Finally I decided to visit the Apple service centre. On 21 Oct 2020 I visited the service centre, they acknowledged the problem in the iPhone Screen and took it with a promise either to fix the screen or change the mobile. I contended, I have bought a brand new iPhone to gift to my daughter and I don’t want a “repaired tag” in this. I want the iPhone to be replaced. They said decision of Apple would be binding on me, I can’t demand anything. I am still waiting to hear from them. I don’t know what Apple is going to do.In the meantime Amazon and the seller are happy to have sold a faulty product to me and the poor me after running from pillar to post is waiting for the mercy of Apple.

So far so good...(1 week user)

I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don’t worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn’t you just need to use your passcode so it isn’t bad. For the most part it’s quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer.

Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro

Firstly thanks to amazon for delivering product safely and on time. I was looking to upgrade my iphone x was using it since 2018 was very much satisfied with it. And since iphone 11 was launched was very much confused wether I should buy pro series or else should stick with 6.1 inch line up people was sharing their thoughts that it's just an xr update with 2 dual camera. Which was confusing decision for me but I made my mind and got iphone 11 and I am really happy with my decision it saved my 50k for it's a paisawasool product for just one more camera and oled display it's not worth to spend that huge amount.Pros:-•Wide angle camera•Supports fast Charing•Stunning looks•Superb Camera quality•Safe and secure device •Flagship A13 Bionic ChipCons:-•The worst slow charger which apple still provide us 5w @1amp•Still have huge notch•Bit costly in India

It’s just beautiful. The iOS is so fluid and smooth. No lags whatsoever. Camera takes awesome pics. The best part is the battery. It easily lasts 1 day and maybe more with fairly intensive use. I am moving from Android to IOS and I already know that I am never ever going back to Android again. The phone feels solid and sturdy in the hand.I don’t have any negatives to write about even though I really thought about writing some because a review is never fair without writing pros and cons. Go for it with eyes closed and you won’t go wrong. Go for a 128 Gigs. You will definitely need it.

Later, when I checked the negative comments (around 15% of overall comments), I was bit worried, as all people commented saying they faced heating issues/camera problem/audio and sound issues. However, I received my mobile yesterday (7 July), fortunately everything is good. I will update my review, if I encounter any aforementioned problems in the future.I gave 4 stars instead of 5 as I had a lot of problem while exchanging my older phone. The delivery was initially scheduled on 6 July, the delivery guy was uneducated and didn't know the exchange process, I wasted my 4 hours for this process on that day. Finally, on 7 July the new delivery guy came and resolved the process.

it will be an understatement if i say iPhone 11 was the worst purchase of my life. i have been using android for as long as i can remember, and iOS doesnt give the flexibility of an Android. I used my brand new iphone for 2 whole days and i was done. i highly doubt if i will ever buy an iPhone ever again.Venting aside, below are the problems i encountered in the 2 days:> My 2 year old OnePlus gives the same battery backup as my 2 day old iphone> THERE IS NO FINGERPRINT SCANNER!! and the password is a 6 digit code, n it frequently keeps asking to enter this rather than unlock my phone with face id.> There is a limited set of alert tones available, each of which is so loud i was startled every single time i got a msg. PS. i use whatsapp for work extensively, there will be at least 60 diff groups im part of. you can imagine how horrible will it be to hear dolby digital kind of sounds before you even wake up> Whatsapp Web just doesnt sync real time. sometimes i get msg in my macbook first and few seconds later, the horrible startling tone is heard from the iPhone>I couldnt transfer anything from my android, the step to transfer data etc from android failed some 20 times before i gave up, i lost all my whatsapp back up, it was a mess.> I used the same SIM as in my OnePlus and i started facing frequent call drops, for the first time

Phone is great but I am really disappointed by amazon service. It was applicable for bonus 1 offer and I was suppose to get cashback of 1250 and an executive said expect it by wednesday but when it dint credit on chking with amazon executive again they said its not applicable!There was no stars or mentioned in FAQs that iphone is not applicable for bonus.Felt like wrong advertisement, cheated and really disappointed by amazon offers and services. Been amazon customer for years and this experience is really very disappointing. Feels like lost the trust in amazon :( Wrong advt and incorrect offers was just never expected from amazon!

 Very Disappointing!😑 This is really sucks. I was very excited about this phone cuz this is Nokia's brand, but after I got this phone; I've seen it's totally empty 😅mean this phone basically based on Google apps and Android, you can't get/see any features designed by Nokia. There were Google Apps only, with stupid launcher. It's like someone flashed a smartphone by using Gapps + Android iso. files. Most of features are missing. Also default camera app doesn't take clear pictures, front camera is so disgusting; to take best pictures u need to download 3rd party apps liks, Open Camera, Gcam etc. In the video i posted u can see the Notification bar, too much old & classic look, missing with features, where in redmi phones, lost of features are available in there. I'm also worried about it's RAM, i don't think it's 4Gb , it's actually 3Gb that's why u can see some lags when u use apps like Instagram, Snapchat.

Why so price difference between 13 and 13 Pro?

Why the hell there is so difference between 13 and 13 Pro? Like 13 (128gb) costs 80k and 13 Pro (128gb) directly costs 1.20L? There actually no major difference between them except the refresh rate, so for that you'll charging 40k extra? First of all after so so so long you'll upgrading your refresh rate from 60 to 90, infact there are phone's having 144 too, but you'll not letting normal people use 90 refresh rate, giving a price difference of 40k? Do you know how much that is for a common man? A person gives is years of saving to buy iPhone, and you'll charge 40k extra for just a refresh rate? Apple company would earn it's whole life but never die in peace, mark my words.

Look wise- it’s very beautiful and esp sierra blue colour is very classy. Mobile grip is good and it doesn’t seem oversize. Sound quality is amazing with theatre  immersive quality. Picture/photo quality is unmatched and it’s intelligent enough to clear even the shaky clicks. Cinematic mode videos are class apart. Overall great experience.

Just a hyped product with nothing special

I upgraded from oneplus 6 to 13 pro 256GB and I must say that except the camera, There is nothing extra ordinary about this phone and I consider myself an idiot to have this purchased. Unless you are purchasing it as a status symbol, Its a stupid decision. Dont fall for the marketing gimmics. My priority was camera and I chose this over S21 ultra as Samsung had a heat up issue.Coming to the camera, I admit that the phone has good post processing and good zooming but I hate that it has no manual control over the camera. The outcome is great and no complaints. In a nutshell, The phone is not a value for money and shouldnt be priced more than 60-70k bracketPS: Oneplus6 is still my Primary phone and I use iphone 13 pro as a secondary device.

If you are planning to buy iPhone then go for 12 or 12 pro. There is no such difference between these 2 models except the bionic chip, smaller notch and cinematic mode in pro models. For 13 and 12 only the bionic chip and the position of the camera.. no other major difference..no point of such a huge difference in price for no good difference..not a good release of Apple this year...

First class camera and amazing battery life. Price is not justified at 1.3L but it is what it is. Using this for past 3 months now and I am happy to have this as a daily driver but somehow i still have to get back to android to get some things done. App collection in android is way better than iOS. But overall I can rely on this phone which I can't do on android be it camera or software experience. Its more integrated and less buggy!

First of all I have not purchased it on Amazon. I've got from official store.So let's discuss the phoneCAMERA- 10/10nothing to say much about iphone camera's. Best photo qualityDISPLAY- 10/10Display is 120hz. People are saying it have 90 hz panel, i was like WTF.Battery- 8/10Good battery, stays a day long but can't beat my old device Nokia 3310 😂Performance-11/10A15 bionic is equal to ps4 pro so yeah you can expect gaming without any kind of lag or frame drop.Why to spend 40k more for this.- Firstly we get a lidar sensor which processes image better- we get more battery- we get one more camera- refresh rateEach point 10k so 10x40 = 40k 😂😂

1) Phone is awesome but there is some catchPrice gap between normal 13 and 13 pro is too much2) we can get offers on iPhone 13 but iPhone 13 pro models attract no offers as such normal 13 models3) camera, processor is too good 👍 But why Indians price is so high as compare to other countries, just because customs and import taxes. The price gap will reduce if pro models starts to assemble in India.

 It is a wonder phone at this price. I just used it for 3 days and almost gone through all the features, just can’t believe it. A made in India product makes me feel proud as well. The battery life, the virtual RAM and the screen quality……to name a few, all are excellent and on par with any phone including IPhone for that matter. I’m using IPhone since 3 years and feel equally better about this phone. Security wise of course not comparable with IPhone. More over the length of the phone is somewhat  appreciative as compared to any phone. However sound quality is not that good but not bad too. Just go for it.

फोन बढिया,फीचर्स भी ढेर सारे ...पर तीन कमजोरी--फास्ट चार्जिग सर्पोट, हेड फोन मिसिंग,और टच सेंसर स्लो

भाई मोबाइल तो स्मार्ट है । पर शायद मैं उतना तेज नहीं हूं क्यूंकि इस फोन में फीचर्स तो एक से बढ़कर एक है, डिजायन, बैटरी, कैमरा और कई सारे फीचर्स बढिया भरे पड़े हैं इस स्मार्ट फोन में।पर.....मैं टच सेंसर से नाखुश हूं, शायद टच स्क्रीन स्लो है या सही से बटन काम नहीं करता पता नहीं ..... इसी मॉडल के और हैंडसेट में भी यही परेशानी है या नहीं , मुझे नहीं पता... पर  कुछ तो लोचा है । टेक्नो कंपनी को इस पर ध्यान देना चाहिये । साथ ही G35 से ऊपर का प्रोसेसर देने से लो- बजट पर यह फोन दमदार फोन बन एकछत्र राज कायम कर लेती क्यूंकि 9000/- के रेंज में यह एक कंप्लीट फोन का तमगा हासिल कर लेता |पर फोन अच्छा है ।हां एक कमी और है जो चार्जिंग समय को लेकर अखरता है कि ये फोन तीन घंटे लगाता है चार्ज होने में, फास्ट चार्जर का सपोर्ट होना चाहिये था साथ ही  ईयर हेड फोन भी मिसिंग है जो आज के डेट में एक जरूरी एसेसरीज है ।

Phone has good looks, but the features mentioned are not good. I didn't find the display and music player appealing. Touchscreen and finger touch are not smoothly working.

 I have ordered this TECNO Spark 8T phone on the recommendation of one of my friends.I have used it in terms of gaming, photography and found this handset extremely useful in this price range.50 MP camera with 5000 mAh battery is just an added advantage.  Finger print sensor along with Face unlock and 4GB 64GB memory is a complete value for money.Just the colour gives an elite look and gaming is good in the phone.If you are looking for a budget phone with good features your search should end here.

This is my first time phone buying experience in Amazon and its not satisfied. Product ok but what I've received it's a refurbished phone.

I am writing this review after using Tecno spark 8T for more than 5 months. Phone performance is good in this segment. This mobile provide dual sim of 4g VOLTE connectivity. You can use both sim for 4g volte connection. I like most the seamlessly data network switching function at your need by single tap. Videos runs without flicker and screen quality is good. Little draw back is it's speaker. Doesn't have dolby sound and speaker sound is also not as per expectation. 50mp Camera quality is good and provide good picture qualities.

Best All Rounder flagship of this year

Bought this phone as a gift for my dad and I’m totally satisfied with my purchase.I feel what is missing these days is an all rounder smartphone and Xiaomi 12 Pro is what fills that gap. When you think about it, an overall good smartphone is made by good camera, good display and sound, and a good processor. And after using this device for a couple of days I have realized that it is great in all these aspects.Processor -  Snapdragon 8 gen 1 is the latest and the best that is out there and Xiaomi 12 Pro has it.Camera - Three cameras with 50+50+50 mp resolution is unheard of. And the result from them is equally stunning.Sound - Another thing unheard of is the quad stereo speakers the phone features and they are tuned by harman kardon. Plus it also supports Dolby atmos.Display - 2k+ amoled display, more than a billion colors, dolby vision, there’s just so much here.Charging - This is another smartphone from xiaomi with 120W fast charging.Looking at all of this you can not deny how well rounded and overall achiever Xiaomi 12 pro is.

I wanted to buy a phone with great one handed design and good cameras. Afterchecking all the options available in the market the choice was clear, Xiaomi 12 Pro. Imust say the in hand feel of Xiaomi 12 Pro is awesome and rounded corners with thecurved display just completes this experience. With three 50 MP cameras, I think Xiaomi12 Pro has the best camera output. It runs on the best industry has to offer that isSnapdragon 8 gen- 1 and android 12 out of the box. I am happy with my choice and willrecommend everyone to consider this whose priority are design and camera.

First of all Don't go for 5 Star Rated Reviews..I think those who has given 5 Star to this mobile might have not used Higher End Mobiles..This is a Bullshit Mobile which you will ever buy..Call Connectivity huge Problem.Corner Touch Problem.Finger Print not working properly.Heat like Burner can explode anytime.The best part of the mobile is that when you Copy or Move data from USB it always get hanged at 100%.Camera Quality like normal mobile, as per pricing they should have given better camera.Xaiomi can never give Class Mobile even if they charge 70000/- because they have habbit to provide cheap quality product.I request you before buying this mobile please for 2 days first use someone else mobile then buy it.My Review is True and Genuine.

Mesmerising design and ticks all flagship boxes!!

Before buying a phone, I have 4 check boxes in my mind and Xiaomi 12 Pro checks allthe boxes.First is Design, on the 12 Pro we get a well rounded and comfortable design. I liked theback glass finish.Second checkbox camera, here we get a triple 50MP camera. With XIaomi’s softwareoptimization we get the best and consistent output.Third checkbox is battery and charging:- Here Xiaomi gives 120Watt charger in the box sowe get to 100% charge in a fraction of an hour and the 4600Mah battery gives you a fullday battery life.The final checkbox is processor, here we get the top of the line Qualcomm Snapdragon 8Gen-1, all the latest game runs smoothly and doing multitasking is also never a problem.

Showstopper Indeed! Best flagship of 2022
","
When I first heard of the xiaomi 12 pro, I wasn't too sure whether the phone would live upto the marketing term of ""The Showstopper""As I was pleasantly surprised, the phone indeed does live upto its reputation. Now, keep in mind that I also have a 13 pro max which is a work phone and I quite enjoyed the cameras on it especially.After getting the Xiaomi 12 Pro, I have to be honest that I haven't used my iPhone much apart from work emails and thats primarily because the camera experience has been fantastic so far. Yes, of course 50 MP resolution on all three cameras is great to have but I think we need to focus on the quality of output and this is incredibly good and consistent across all cameras not just in day light but even low light.Ultra Night Mode is a gamechanger and so is the focusing with profocus technology. No more blurry photos and you get night mode on all cameras.The display experience has also been great indoors and outdoors and I did try watching a few videos and bit of films on Netflix and the experience is amazing especially thanks to the audio. The amoled screen with dolby vision and hdr10+ is amazing but I feel the audio is one part others overlook.13 pro max is loud but the bottom speaker is louder while the top one is quite feeble. This gives equal loud output but thanks to the quad speaker with 2 woofer and 2 tweeter, Im getting better bass in music and movies also feel more immersive.Haptics are great too for gaming and typing. Performance has been great so far and I was worried about 8Gen1 as my friend has an S22 Ultra that over heats especially when gaming or using the cameras, luckily on this, no heating or issue with cameras.Charging is a lifechanger too. Had already tried 11T Pro which I got for my wife but now with this, its smarter too. Surge P1 they say is indias first intelligent charging chip, I love how fast it charges. Using boost mode I get 18-19 mins 100% from almost a flat battery but in most cases I charge my phone from 15 or 20% and this takes approx 15 mins only and unlike other flagships, they are giving the 120W charger in box. I am using the same for my Dell XPS also.Overall, I was not sure if this would be a great purchase but very happy to say that it has been amazing so far and I would definitely recommend this to others as well.

I am happy with my choice and willrecommend everyone to consider this whose priority are design and camera.

Genuine Review.

First of all Don't go for 5 Star Rated Reviews..I think those who has given 5 Star to this mobile might have not used Higher End Mobiles..This is a Bullshit Mobile which you will ever buy..Call Connectivity huge Problem.Corner Touch Problem.Finger Print not working properly.Heat like Burner can explode anytime.The best part of the mobile is that when you Copy or Move data from USB it always get hanged at 100%.Camera Quality like normal mobile, as per pricing they should have given better camera.Xaiomi can never give Class Mobile even if they charge 70000/- because they have habbit to provide cheap quality product.I request you before buying this mobile please for 2 days first use someone else mobile then buy it.My Review is True and Genuine.

Mesmerising design and ticks all flagship boxes!!
","
Before buying a phone, I have 4 check boxes in my mind and Xiaomi 12 Pro checks allthe boxes.First is Design, on the 12 Pro we get a well rounded and comfortable design. I liked theback glass finish.Second checkbox camera, here we get a triple 50MP camera. With XIaomi’s softwareoptimization we get the best and consistent output.Third checkbox is battery and charging:- Here Xiaomi gives 120Watt charger in the box sowe get to 100% charge in a fraction of an hour and the 4600Mah battery gives you a fullday battery life.The final checkbox is processor, here we get the top of the line Qualcomm Snapdragon 8Gen-1, all the latest game runs smoothly and doing multitasking is also never a problem.

Showstopper Indeed! Best flagship of 2022
","
When I first heard of the xiaomi 12 pro, I wasn't too sure whether the phone would live upto the marketing term of ""The Showstopper""As I was pleasantly surprised, the phone indeed does live upto its reputation. Now, keep in mind that I also have a 13 pro max which is a work phone and I quite enjoyed the cameras on it especially.After getting the Xiaomi 12 Pro, I have to be honest that I haven't used my iPhone much apart from work emails and thats primarily because the camera experience has been fantastic so far. Yes, of course 50 MP resolution on all three cameras is great to have but I think we need to focus on the quality of output and this is incredibly good and consistent across all cameras not just in day light but even low light.Ultra Night Mode is a gamechanger and so is the focusing with profocus technology. No more blurry photos and you get night mode on all cameras.The display experience has also been great indoors and outdoors and I did try watching a few videos and bit of films on Netflix and the experience is amazing especially thanks to the audio. The amoled screen with dolby vision and hdr10+ is amazing but I feel the audio is one part others overlook.13 pro max is loud but the bottom speaker is louder while the top one is quite feeble. This gives equal loud output but thanks to the quad speaker with 2 woofer and 2 tweeter, Im getting better bass in music and movies also feel more immersive.Haptics are great too for gaming and typing. Performance has been great so far and I was worried about 8Gen1 as my friend has an S22 Ultra that over heats especially when gaming or using the cameras, luckily on this, no heating or issue with cameras.Charging is a lifechanger too. Had already tried 11T Pro which I got for my wife but now with this, its smarter too. Surge P1 they say is indias first intelligent charging chip, I love how fast it charges. Using boost mode I get 18-19 mins 100% from almost a flat battery but in most cases I charge my phone from 15 or 20% and this takes approx 15 mins only and unlike other flagships, they are giving the 120W charger in box. I am using the same for my Dell XPS also.Overall, I was not sure if this would be a great purchase but very happy to say that it has been amazing so far and I would definitely recommend this to others as well.

The 120W charging makes you change your charging habits.

Excellent Flagship Smart Phone from Xiaomi
","
After two weeks of extensive research of different makes of mobile phones though several online reviews, studying technical specs, cost etc. I have decided to fix Xiaomi 12 Pro Global version. Excellent display, breathtaking very fast charging time, stunning photos and videos, smooth OS Android 12 & MIUI Global13. No heating problem at all.RAM is showing 8GB+3GB.I like the Second Home screen feature, Eye tracking, movement tracking and display screen (using Lens feature).I have changed my mind from iPhone Promax 13 & Oneplus  10 Pro to Xiaomi 12 Pro.I will update after a few weeks of usage

Great phone from Xiaomi
","
Received very prompt delivery from Amazon!The phone genuinely looks like a flagship with glass back, metal frame & premium camera setup. The finish on my black color variant also looks & feels great. Performance wise also it seems top notch. I have been playing some games from the last couple of days and I haven't observed any lag or heating. But the one thing that stands out for me is the multimedia experience on this phone. Clarity and picture quality is amazing, when paired with the great acoustics the overall experience is lifelike.Camera also performs good & the pictures in ultra night mode are truly superior.My one small complaint would be that this phone feels a little slippery in hand, so I need to be a little cautious if I am not using the protective case.Otherwise, it is a very good phone packed with all the latest features & Android 12.  Highly recommend this device to people looking for flagship phones.

Awesome Phone! Go for it

Bought this phone from Amazon and it was delivered in one day. I tested the devices primarily in three departments:Battery: As usual, I deliberately drained the battery completely for the first time to test how long it actually takes to get fully charged and was amazed to see that it actually got charged to 98% in 18 mins, which is truly amazing.Camera: Was excited to see that the pictures on this are very close to DSLR quality, especially the photos in the dark and the portraits are excellent.Sound: Was listening to music to check if the quad speakers make any significant difference.Overall this is an amazing device and totally worth the amount I spent on it. Really amazed by the device performance and satisfied with my purchase.

There are no complaints and the phone was delivered within a day...I've been using this gadget for the last 2 days now, and I believe the following make it a great purchase1. Excellent display, screen, and overall feel. The phone feels amazing in the hand and does not feel heavy and bulky like other phones that generally are.2. The camera and color balance are unquestionably superior to prior devices I’ve owned (Oneplus 5 and Samsung S20FE).3. SD 8 gen 1 makes navigating the phone a breeze4. The In Display fingerprint sensor is extremely fast and responsive.5. The sound quality is outstanding. It does make it stand apart from other devices.6. MIUI 13 is excellent and has come a long way from its days of the past.

Great device with some improvement needed
","
So after using this for like 4-5 days after purchase :1) There is no automatic charging disconnect ion after 100% battery , it will keep you showing charging even when battery is at 100%.2) Device is bit slippery and back cover is must.3) There is a bug in camera where the reflection of Street light / Head lights are seen upside down on the display. ( Annoying bug )4) Camera quality is good, but can be improved more.5) No notification led. It has breathing pulse effect on display, but that might consume power.6) When using 2K+ resolution with 120Hz , a normal 15W charger is unable to charge battery, instead the battery keeps depleting over time. ( This needs to be fixed)7) When we press volume button to increase / decrease the intensity, the display suddenly goes very bright while the overlay is active and then reduces on its own when the volume overlay is gone.8) Don't put the 120W charger over night and sleep away ! I did smeel something burning and was worried. But seems everything was fine. Take caution about this.9) A normal 15W charger can charge the device in about 2 and half hours with FHD+ and 60Hz settings.10) Phone is a bit , might be tricky to hold the device, but it will vary depending on users.11) Gcam is supported by this device.12) Phone gets warm when intensive task are being used and games are played for long. Chances of getting it hot are higher when the device is at 2K+ and 90Hz/120Hz.13) Battery backup is overall good i will say, it needs be improved.14) Dolby Vision, Dolby Atoms, HDR10+ works fine.(HDR content supported on youtube)15) Playing music for long time on speakers will drain battery.

Worth it , but no tempered glass available in the market

[-- changed my review to 1 star because of the random brightness dimming issue even though auto brightness is off , apparently they have limited the maximum brightness . for this reason the display doesn't live upto its true potential . its a software issue they can fix it but they dont. even after multiple requests --]i mainly bought the device because of the value for money and most importantly the display . the display is top notch. here are some things that i noticed.#1.  the wqhd 2k display is totally worth it , colors are sharp , clarity is excellent , dolby visions further optmizes the video and images. dolby vision gives you feeling of watching movies on big tv screen . you have to enable it for every app , filter style hdr . but cant find any good tempered glass in the market for this device. that fits ut correctly#2.  camera produces very good colors  . i have used other flagships and its much better than anything i have seen so far first hand. rest you can see in attached images. although camera isn't my priority but i know when i see a good camera.#3.  heating is what i was worried about but it even heats less than my older device with sd865 .  here it is hot climate these days . but for normal usage its battery remained within 38-42 degree celcius . cpu too ranges between 38 to 45 depending on your usage . ambient temperature is important factor here . i did not do gaming as of now , but will update later in this review after playing BGMI . also the device cools faster than any other device that i have used . [ edit : i played BGMI and very smooth experience . you do neeed to tweak some graphic settings though. 90hz rfresh rate is sufficient for this game , did not feel it heating more than the ordinary, do not play games while charging this device i suggest ]#4. speed and productivity is super smooth . sd 8 gen 1 is worth it . all apps open so smoothly . i found big difference in compare to my previous device mi 10t pro  which has sd865 .  if i had to guess it is almost 100% jump in terms of speed and performance.#6. dolby atmos is good , increases sound quality#7. battery backup is i guess normal . i don't feel much difference Between sd865 and sd 8 gen 1 battery consumption. if you want your battery SOT longer . do not use charging boost feature. battery -backup will increase then.#8. miui 13 is good optmized in this device in  compare to miui 12.5 that i used to have in my older device  .#9. indisplay fingerprint scanner is not that fast i think it needs further software optimisations. it gives warning of ""only use compatible screen protector"" , but do not provide any information where i can  find that  . i am yet to receive tempered glass that i ordered , i will update once i apply that and see if fingerprint sensor still works after applying or not  .#10. there is no pre- applied screen protector#11. silicon back case cover that comes with it... is really really good.  perfectly designed.#12. design is good . doesnt feel bulky . weight distribution is really nicely done.#13.  opera Mauve color seems good that i bought, but i did expect better#14. the back part i dont know if it is gorilla glass or something else . but it feels different. may be its scratch resistant or not i have no idea . but its definitely dust resistant.overall excellent flagship . i got 12 gb 256gb version for only 57k after discount. worth it.i bought this device after comparing it with other sd 8 gen 1 , found this one good on paper so chose it . now i can say it is as good as in reality too .i will update the review if i face any issues ,Note- for temperature monitor use 'cpu monitor' app it shows overall cpu temperature and not just of one core.

Purchased the Xiaomi 12 Pro recently. Here are my initial thoughtsDisplay & Sound - Watching videos on the phone is a great experience with 2k+ Amoled display, dolby atmos and vision, and quad speakersBattery - Don’t have to think about charging - it charge 100% in approx. 18 minsCamera - pictures come out great! Night mode is my personal favorite - the images are of very high quality.OS - Earlier MIUI used to be a concern for me but they have improved it significantly. It's much more customizable and efficient.Processor - it's got  the latest one - Snapdragon 8 Gen 1

Placed my order on the very first day and got delivery the next day. Fantastic experiencewith Amazon, as always. First of all, the design on the phone is just amazing. The metalcamera module and the velvet matte finish back feels just amazing in hand.I have been using a galaxy s10 edge prior to this and upgrading to this phone has beenan amazing experience. From initial impressions, the 2k AMOLED display is great. Havewatched a couple of movies on Netflix and Hotstar and the Dolby vision support justmakes the whole experience so wholesome. The camera just takes breathtaking nightshots, especially the auto-focus capabilities of this device is too good. The brand is alsogiving a 120W charger in box which is a good news these days, when other brands areshipping phones without chargers in box.

Battery is patheticI discorded my old phone redmi note 8 pro; bought 2 yrs back (for 18-19k I guess) as it's battery got drained in 1 day and bought this phone for more than 50k and battery backup is lesser than my 2 yrs old phone..camera performance is similar..

Best flagship mobile of the year. Excellent dispay and very smooth to use. Camera is superb . Charging speed is the top feature with good battery backup. What else needed ? All extra features are also covered like NFC, Dolby Atmos, Curved Display, etc. Somewhat heating issue at the time of charging. May be due to 120 W charger. Its totally value for money purchase.

True Flagship Killer

I thought it would be difficult to switch from iPhone to Xiaomi or ios to Android but I must say that it was a good decision.This phone is truly a flagship killer and do justice to it's price of 55-60k.Pros:It will be worth noting the flagship features I like are it's cristal clear 2k amoled display, beautifully designed curved edges, latest snapd 8 gen 1 professor, fastest charging ever on any smartphone, best haptic sensor, crazily functional and easy to use Mi user interfaceinterface. Best Camera's which takes natural looking images in most of the conditions and last but not the least it's beautiful design which feels up market.Cons: NoneI didn't see any heating issues in my device. It gets warm while charging which is common with fast charging, metal body or high end processors.I really recommend this phone if your budget is between 55k-65k. This device from Xiaomi won't disappoint you in any point of time. Thanks!

As premium as it can get!

First of all, the phone packs an absolute beast of a camera setup. Be it low light conditions, difficult light conditions with background light, or just plain human portraits, the camera just nails it. I am in absolute love with the cameras. The next best thing is the display and sound, gorgeous display and the sound is so clear. Having moved from Pixel myself, I can feel the difference in the multimedia experience. It takes some getting used to MiUI after having moved from Pixel, but as of everything feels quite seamless. The design is minimalistic, yet elegant. The texture does feel like velvet matte finish and there's just the right amount of texture that helps grip the phone better.I feel the phone would have been almost perfect had it come with an IP68 rating, but that's passable. Overall extremely happy with the phone.

If you are looking for a phone with excellent camera and gaming experience, this is the perfect phone.

I would definitely recommend this to all those who are looking for a phone with amazing camera and superb gaming experiences as I am completely satisfied with the performance.

Almost a flagship, but with lot of sacrifices and issues
","
The ratings i gave are considering other flagship phones in nearby price range from competitorsj(OnePlus/Samsung/Oppo/Vivo/Realme/Motorola/Apple/Pixel/Asus)!Battery drain is very significant even when idle, didn't expect it in a flagship. (Looses 8-15% at night, when always on display is off, vibration is off, mobile data/WiFi is off)Also, even for for just casual usages there is slight heating issue, when outside temperature is 30-33°C (an average temperature in India; For those in cold places, there are issues too... keep reading!)On gaming, it throttles a lot along with overheating at times, maybe given performance equivalent to Snapdragon 855 or 845, when heated up! Maybe going with Mi 11 Ultra would be a better choice, or go for 8Gen1 devices from other companies or wait for 8Gen1+! I really regret the decision to buy this phone, been using it for 1 week now!!!I have been using Xiaomi products for many years, and decided to believe and buy a flagship from this company. But so far the experience is disappointing, and gives a midrange feel in many areas... Over heating when used outside, for just regular usages, like Gmail, browsing the internet, Amazon etc... Also, though the charging is fast, the battery drain is fast too...And the camera needs a lot of optimization. Daylight photos, many times it's over exposed and over saturated and cases can be reddish. And HDR doesn't always work well. Its sometimes a disappointing performance, considering its supposed to be a flagship camera! Even that can be fixed by a software update...And maybe a good Gcam port is all I can hope for, if someone makes it, as i don't have much hope from Xiaomi... But surely there are hardware issues too...Overheating is surely somewhat an hardware issue, given the negative feedback of 8Gen1...But the implementation in Mi 12 pro, seems so poor, and it makes things worse. It's advertising industry leading cooling systems, but performance isn't reflecting it!Also, i recently went to a hill station(temperature was 13-20°C) and on trying the camera there, the phone heats up even there on using camera for few minutes, and fog got formed in the internal camera lens of the main camera unit, which is quite disappointing!  (Note: it's not outside the camera, that it can be wiped, but inside the camera.And saw in online forums and YouTube that it's a general issue with this model, especially the Chinese and Indian ones! Search and you can find the issue)Hope the device doesn't get under-clocked, because I and most people who opt for a flagship care about high end performance.So Xiaomi, if you are reading this, we all hope, an alternative fix for overheating can be implemented with software that doesn't involve sacrificing the performance of 8Gen1! I will wait and see how Xiaomi takes feedback and fixes these issues(I have filled feedback using the feature provided within the phone)...I am not even sure if customer feedback is even considered and I am doubting the trust and decision of buying a premium phone from Xiaomi...On a positive note, the screen is excellent, main camera module is great in low light (though there are hiccups at times), also zoom camera isn't great, given its a 2x telephoto!The IR blaster, is a nice to have. Also it checks most of the features that is expected in a flagship. But it doesn't have an official IP rating, though they say its built to be IP 53 compliant. But flagships should be having IP 68.Performance is smooth, which is expected, but there are software glitches at times, and the issue of overheating and battery drain! As the battery keeps draining fast, and if we keep charging with 120W, battery life is a question... Don't think it will last much long!The charger is insane, but heavy and not very travel friendly....  And claimed charging speed of 18 mins isn't achievable unless phone doesn't heat up, which isn't possible unless you give it active cooling while charging!Realistically you get from 0-100% in 25-30 mins!

Lovely design, Impressive Camera, fast for sure, and the same MiUi that we all hate
","
So far good.,I'm switching from 8 years of OnePlus experience to MiUi., Definitely hard. Initially my mind didn't allow to like MiUi., But slowly getting there with help of themes, Nova launcher, lot of customisation changes.I bought this 12 Pro for only reason - Camera.Only 2 days so far, didn't test it much, but I can say it's definitely capable. I'll update this review definitely with more samples. That rose click was in extreme day light condition, handled we it seems. And the Jasmine white petals are also good., Trying my luck with fish - definitely need to click more shots to get a perfect one.Heats normally as any SD (not 8gen1, just like any SD - it also heats). Didn't play hardcore games, but while using Camera for more than 30 mins definitely heated up the device, but it's normal imo. And also it's 1st day, system definitely need sometime to adjust. And also it's damn hot here in coastal summer.According to the Performance - it's fast, smooth etc., But that's not my primary req - because I'm still happy with OP6.Display is great. Glass design is lovely. Battery seems to suck asusual. I didn't turn on that boost charge mode, I never need it i guess.

A comfortable android flagship with great cameras

Been a fan of Mi 11 Ultra but couldn’t get one last year. Bought Xiaomi 12 pro and super impressed with the phone so far. Below are my thoughts on the phoneLooks dammm Gorgeous and hand feel is so good. Minimalistic-ally premium. Display is crisp and delight to use and watch content. While SD8Gen1 is infamous for heating, I personally didn’t face any heating issues nor any lags/ stutter while playing CoD, asphalt. Multitasking is smooth.. Thing that appealed to me most is the Camera. Consistent output from all 3 50MP cameras. Takes absolutely flawless images in almost all scenarios. Especially Low light performance is just top notch. I use wireless charging most of the times, works well. Wired charging charges from around 10-100% in approx 15 minutes.I like my phone to look good and one that gives me flawless usage experience. Most importantly, have great set of Cameras. And Xiaomi 12 pro delivers it all. Great offers made the deal even sweeter.

Well the phone has the looks and does feel premium.Pros:1)  Best camera, very good competition to one plus and apple2) Amazing charging speed, so I test at 13% to 100% took around 15min3) you guys will love the display and audio.4) best part is when I connected the phone wired with my car the audio quality got enhanced, not sure how it happened, may be because phone speakers are Harman and I have the same installed in car(Nexon EV)5) wifi connectivity is really awesomeCons:1)  phone does get heated up when camera is used for more than 10min2) while charging it gets heated if you enbled quick charge3) I can see a very lite lag while taking videos in all modes, I also replaced my phone thinking it could be hardware issue but this looks like it can be fixed with a software update.Over all its a good package for the price offered at least it doesn't bend and break like one plus 10 for the price.

Mixed feelings
","
Display, speed, quality, camera, etc. --  everything is top notch. Far better than we can imagine.But, battery is utterly disappointing. I do not play games or run software tests. My usage is akin to an average mobile user - surfing net, apps, yt, etc. Even for this average usage, if we charge to full in morning, the charging drops to less than 30% by eve. If a little more is done, phone gets heated up quickly. This, with all optimisations checked.So I feel the specs are beautiful, camera unparalleled, but but the phone has got not enough energy to fulfil those specs for longer duration. If not for heating issue at normal usage and battery drain even after optimisations (viz.; 60hz, fhd, etc) makes this buy to have mixed feelings.

Design and build wise it's something unique you can rarely seen...good design and build.5.

No ip rating2. No Xiaomi dialer

Good phone, but with drawbacks
","
Pros - Good build quality. Good camera! Battery life is good if used for day to day activities. Good connectivity over wifiDrawbacks - Most important - This does Not have a truly curved screen! The screen is flat, covered by a curved glass!!! One can compare the flow of text on phones like oppo find x2 and iqoo 9 Pro and you will notice that on these phones the text and pictures bend to the sides when you scroll horizontally. But in this phone you can clearly see that it's a flat scroll!!!Connectivity over mobile network is not good in closed rooms. While the Asus rog 5 and the Oppo find x2 show upto 4 bands on the network indicator this phone goes down to 2! -95 to -100 for the Asus and the Oppo while it's -115 to -119 for the Xiaomi! That's poor!Has a good display - but not anywhere near the Oppo find x2 which is way brighter! Difficult to believe that this phone has a peak brightness of 1500 nits!Even though this is on Android 12 the miui software is not as good as color os. Recent apps can't be swiped up like in other phones, they need to be swiped to the side!Accessibility features for apps like Nova launcher etc keep getting disabled even if battery optimisation is turned off! Features like double tap to lock screen don't work, which is very bad!!!There is no option to pick colours from the wallpaper or to change the colour accent of the icons etc, which is disappointing!Finally one important point - the first phone which i received was faulty. It failed to detect the sim and used to heat up and force the user to wipe the data, and if not used to keep rebooting! Amazon replaced the phone, and the second piece is working normally. If anyone faces the same issue please inform Amazon immediately.

Complete flagship with minor flaws
","
Here is my honest review after 3 days of usage.Got it at a price of 42K+ with an exchange and card discount. Excellent device with features at this price.1) Camera - Awesome pictures with details during daylight conditions. I haven't tried night pics till now but it somewhat struggled in indoor pub lighting with Palco and spotlights of various colors. Selfie camera is average at best. Overall 8.5 out of 10.2) Display - Awesome clarity and excellent for content viewing. Overall 10 out of 103) Performance - Excellent. I am not a gamer but day-to-day activities work flawlessly. Overall 9 out of 104) MIUI - Much improved this time with MIUI 13. Didn't see any small bugs which were visible in my earlier Redmi device. There is of course room for improvement. I have used MIUI for long so doesn't matter to me anymore. The phone still running on the March update so Xiaomi needs to work on the update policy since it's a flagship.5) Battery - This is where it struggles. Didn't get a full day backup with moderate to heavy usage like photography, youtube videos, calling, etc in the highest setting i.e QHD+ and 120Hz refresh rate. The 120-watt charger makes up for this disappointing battery life. Hope Xiaomi resolves it with a software update. Haven't faced any heating issues yet with normal charging mode but it gets slightly warm. Overall 6 out of 10.6) Speakers - Decent but could have been a bit louder. Overall 8.5 out of 10.Pros - Rear camera, display, Fast charging, day-to-day performance, features.Cons - Bad battery backup, selfie camera, lack of IP ratingIf you can ignore a few cons then it is an excellent device for the price point of 53K (including offers). You can save an additional amount with an exchange of an old device. Recommended with conditions apply.

Just shy of being a flagship killer
","
Review after about 2 week's usage.Looks super premium though feels a tad heavy owing to it's metallic setup near the camera.Had minor heating issues in the initial days but has been ironed out with few minor tweaks.Battery should have been 5000 mAH at this price range. After having disabled auto-start for each of the apps and changing the refresh rate to 60 Hz, able to get a battery backup of 15+hrs with average usage. 120 Watt charging does work but heats up the device which is normal though would suggest to use normal charging if the battery life is to be prolonged unless in urgent need of power.Rear camera is pretty good though the optical zoom is limited to 2x. Ultra wide capture is good enough with minimal distortion.Front camera is good when used in normal lighting, however, it brightens the image too much to ones liking when taken against a bright backdrop. Hoping for it to get resolved in the next update.Please note that I had a weird experience wherein the rear camera lens was covered with moisture trapped between the lens and protective glass cover whilst switched on for the very first time. I had to switch off the rear camera for the trapped moisture to subside after having to wait for few minutes.Has dual speakers labelled Harmon Kardon on them but has a strange echo being generated while playing few genres. I am still trying to figure it out by tweaking the equalisers.OS has minor glitches like the default apps set doesn't work as they should and the files open in MI based apps only.Overall a good buy though could have been a flagship killer had these minor glitches been ironed out.

1. Buy a powerbank first 🥲, you will need it!2. Great camera, with latest Gcam support3. Bad selfie camera (especially against the light)4. Speaker quality is great, but not loud5. Call reception problem sometimes6. Great display7. 120W is a gimmick, kinda, u need in-box charger and cable to use, so either carry them always or you have a phone with a bad battery!Honestly only go for this if you need a less expensive flagship with great back camera. No other useful flagship feature!

After waiting from  FEb_2022 ,Finally I have decided to go for it as this phone have all most all Flagship specifications you need in today's competition era...where every week you find new phone is launching.*Display is 10 /10 it's impressive and Brightness is 1700 nits (max) ,Supports HDR+, you have both option to run on FHD+ and WHD + ,it's too beautiful with live wallpapers. I bet you will not put phone down .* Sound is mind-blowing ,what we need stereo speakers and this time Xiaomi Given 4 speakers ,2 tweeter and 2 woofers.*Calling quality is too crispy ,even on 2 tower signal of Airtel ,I able to here clear and loud sound.* Miui 13 is Impressive version , you have unlimited choices of Live wall papers...Theme...Ringtones. Fontswith very less bloat applications. Even many of unwanted application which is pre-installed ,you can  easily uninstall.*Charging is too fast. Battery stays  it takes less then 25 minutes from 10 to 100 % chargingand it's goes for  1.5 days ,in normal conditions without playing game.*Camera is also promising ..though I have not taken too many pictures* Processor is flagship 8 SOC gen 1 Snapdragon.So, at this rate this is far better for all competitors available on 8 SOC gen 1.Just close your eyes and press ""Buy Now"" , you will be more then satisfied .Only IP68 rating is not there ,but other competitors are also not have recently launched in last 2 months , except S22 ultra.and that not make sense to pay 1 lakh for phone when you have all features in just half of price in Xiaomi 12 pro.

Pros:1. Awesome display, Netflix HDR is supported and with video toolbox you can enable HDR effect on all video players and it looks absolutely stunning. 2K upscaling, smooth frame rate features also supported for videos.2. Very good cameras. The stock camera app captures good quality images. With a proper gcam it can beat pixel 6 pro imo.3. Speakers are okay. One thing with earpiece, I have noticed that with Airtel sim the volume is low but with Jio it's very loud and clear. Issues with Airtel maybe.4. It's an Android Enterprise recommended device so you can setup work profile securely.5. IR remote has become underrated, but it is really useful if you travel a lot.Neutral:1. Based on reviews I thought battery would be very bad but to my surprise it gives about 7-8 hours SoT from 100-1% (after debloating ofcourse). In comparison other 4500 mAh batteries from other brands give 6 hr SoT. And the 120W charging is there for quick 20 mins full charge. So no issues there.Cons:1. MIUI India version is not properly optimized yet. Can be fixed with software updates.2. Not a lot of authentic UV tempered glasses are available. Searching for one is a real hassle. You can get one from local market but make sure it fits perfectly.

Overall the phone is great with beautiful display great inhand feel great haptics. But the battery life in my 4 day usage is average. I don't know if this will be fixed via updates or not but till now it's not very good. I had a 4000 mah phone  last and it lasted thr same as this maybe it's because of the processor or thr refresh rate but it should be improved via updates. Other than that the phone's really great and if you are an average user the battery will last the whole day easily so not so bad either. I don't use cameras that much so can't really comment on that but so far looks really good and the limited photos I have clicked have come out great. The couture blue color I bought looks premium and classy too but if you have the option go for the mauve one.P.S: The delivery by the Amazon courier really sucks and took 5 days to arrive from a destination just 5 hours away from my location. And took more than a day to deliver from the warehouse nearby.

ReviewI've been using this mobile for the last 30 days now, and I believe the following make it a great purchase of this mobile1. Processor - Everyone knows how powerful 8gen1 is but the real problem with this cpu is heating.2. Ram & Storage - I purchased a 12+256GB variant that they are latest and fast.3. Display - FHD+ and WHD+option available here and Custom Refresh Rate is available with 60,90,120fps, pure smooth curved display,you are always happy with display if you buy this mobile its his best highlights and really great display.3. Battery - Even though it's 4600mhz but it's decreasing like hell, I am an heavy user so it makes me charge 2 times a day, normal users will get 25% of battery left by the end of the day.4. Charging - It's good that 120W Charger brick is provided in the box, thanks to Xiaomi for providing in the box, 120W charging is good, at first mobile charges with normal speed even though we charge with 120W charger untill we turn on turbo charge of option in settings, after turning it on Mobile will take nearly 30mins to 100%.5. Camera - All 3(50MP) With OIS Cameras in back are tremendous all segments , it's up to the benchmark mark in that price segment.The front camera needs little improvement by providing 4k options in the video department.6. Sound - Quad stereo speaker set-up tuned Harman Kardon, comes with Dolby Atmos and is working well.7. UI - Personally I am using Mi mobiles since it's 1st launch in india, i used different versions in previous models, but its way much better then budget mobiles, miui it has less bugs and more premium no ads till now in my usage.8. Look - I love this mobile because of its look ,too beautiful mobile , even its 6.73inch screen but didn't feel we were using big screen and weight management is too good, camera design , curved display design and back all things make it so beautiful9. Extra Features - ir blaster, notification light, type c to 3.5mm in box ,wifi 6 , Bluetooth 5.2 and solid victus glass in front and gorilla glass in back.Cons. -1. No 3.5mm jack2. Quick Battry Drain for heavy users.3. No IP rating in this flagship mobile.No more issues found on this mobile.If you are looking for a premium mobile under 53k then this is a great choice.

Great things are Camera, Amoled E5 display which can now be  compared with Samsung flagship displays and the beast  mode in fast charging.

People who are using samsung amoled display would be satisfied with this display of 12 ProBad side is yes it does overheat but at a manageable pace.Sound Quality in speaker isnt that great itno IP rating no FM radio but still manageable I would say.Its a big phone guyz so keep in mind before buying itEditing thisNot sure about other people, but I find android 12 in MI 12 Pro is quite a mess. Apps are loading late, apps like Spotify not workingToggling between apps is taking time. It is seriously underutilizing the strong hardware

Legendary PHONE FOR ""53k""

 This is one of the best phone given the price for 53k. Slightly heats sometimes and there is no branded case available currently. It doesn't come with screen guard pre applied. I feel the design is quite simple could have been a little more good looking for the price and xiaomi could have made this phone software  adfree .Other than this this is one of the well built phone and one of the best phone from xiaomi.

Truly worth the money spent! Even if you go broke!

My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can’t believe what I’m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn’t disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and I’m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don’t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it.

Though we talk a lot about high price for iPhones, this is worth the amount. Smooth touch, perfect to hold in hand. For the screen size of 6.1"", it looks small overall. I could have gone for pro max but more than 1.5L budget is way too much for me :-)* Good battery back-up (With low battery mode always on, 5 hours of talk-time, around 2 hours of twitter and 2 hours of whatsapp usage, 1 hour of songs listening, 1 hour of rummy/candy crush games and notification of all these items, the battery comes for more than 24 hours for me)* Getting charged quickly from 20% to 100% within 2 hours* Perfect camera and I love that 'Live' photo option* Body design is awesome. When I held it in my hand for the first time, felt really happy about the design and the size of the iPhone 13.

Switched over from Android because of how much time got wasted on it, both in choosing which phone to buy and after buying a phone. And now, things work when I want. It might not be 100% personalised, but it gets the job done.  But, some basic features like a good telephoto camera and hassle free sharing are missing because that's how Apple became the richest company: forcing it's customers to buy more of it's products.Still, if you're a working professional who appreciates a phone that does everything that a phone should do, and does it well, you can buy one of these.

Not worth 64K, iPhone is such a hype.
","
After using for almost a month, I don’t feel that this iPhone is worth 64K.EY me brief my review.Pros:Excellent battery life.Nice sound.Nice Back Camera.Video streams smoothly.Cons:1. Doesn’t take good selfies. Literally bad at taking selfies makes you look more ugly.2. Touch is ok ok not as per apple standards but it’s soft.3. Literally hard to transfer data from android to iPhone.4. iCloud storage is only 3 GB after that you need to pay for upgrade, better go for 128GB variant.5. No jack for headphones it is only compatible with Bluetooth headphones, another drawback which I was not aware before buying.6. Most of you would be aware that it doesn’t comes with a charger and you have to buy separately.7. If your hands are wet this phone won’t work. I don’t know if it’s really ip68 waterproof kinda stuff because earlier I had Samsung galaxy S8 and it used to work in water and with wet hands also.Overall, it is highly overpriced as per the features. I haven’t tried it for gaming yet so can’t say anything about it. I would not recommend anyone to buy iPhone due to overpriced if u have extra money to waste then go for it.

you really don't need to upgrade if you bought a new iPhone last year. But anyone with an iPhone 11 or older will find enough new parts and features to consider the new modelsScreenThe screen is notably better than last year's. It's the first iPhone with Apple's ProMotion display, a very high refresh-rate screen technology that was introduced on the iPad Pro in 2017.The screen can adjust to the content on the page to help save battery life and make things feel smoother. If you're just reading a website, for example, it might refresh less frequently and save battery life. But then if you're gaming or scrolling through a long webpage, it'll refresh really fast to make everything much smoother.BatteryBattery life is top-notch and lasts longer than any other iPhone on the market. Unless you're playing games for hours and hoursThat's thanks to a combination of a newer processor, a new screen and a bigger battery. I streamed nine hours of movies, for example, with just over 50% brightness, and still had more than half the battery left.CameraThe regular wide-angle, the zoom and the ultra-wide-angle lenses on the back now allow in more light, which means they're better at taking pictures in the dark.The HDR feature is also better in situations where your subject might have a lot of light behind them, which can normally make people in a picture look dark — all the iPhone 13 phones can keep color and detail even if the sun is right behind someone.You can get really close to an object, like a blueberry or a flower, and capture a lot of detail.

These days phones are so much the same.

Redmi 9 hhoo, 9, 9🤩, 9, changed mind
","
Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.

It is a just ok kind of phone. Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use. It is completely waste of money. Do not buy this mobile.

Worst product ever as the camera quality is very poort rear as well as front. Amazon was not ready to take the return as they have a new policy now which is replacement policy so they will get you a replacement but won't take it back. Bought that in sale as had heard from friends that redmi phones are good but it ain't. Will suggest not to buy at all from Amazon as it's better to go and buy from the store atleast they take 500rs and will exchange the product. Speaker is poor you can not hear properly on speaker at all. Product is not worth in this price range as one can get better options by payin 1000-2000 bucks extra.

Don't look for Xiaomi with Helio chipset. Buy motorola E7 insted of this.

Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3. Under 9000 INR4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)5. Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5. Building quality is poor. As well as camera are very dissatisfied.6. Useless camera bump for 2 poor camera only just for marketing showing 3 circles.7. Loaded with bloatware and adware. Unauthorised data transfer to China.If possible go for Motorola E7 around the same price and you will have great experience with Snapdragon and clean android experience.

 Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps

Cons :- Orange Back different from that shown in product pictures. Not attractive.- No battery charging indicator light.Once the mobile goes in sleep mode, you cannot figure if it is charging or not.- Defective Sound System : volume is generally low. No Bass At All. Sound Volume goes up and down on its own while playing songs/video.- Extremely Short (half meter) charging cable- Micro-USB B-type port- Outdated handset. Not worth the money.- No RETURN Option despite receiving defective piece- No Option to schedule technician visit before replacement window closes (all slots permanently full)Stuck with a defective handset.No scope of Return & purchasing another model.This feels like fraud.Disappointed with Amazon for the first time.

Go for Redmi 8a Dual instead
","
If there is an option I would 3.5It's been 2 days since I got the phone and here are positive and negatives with comparison to Redmi 8a Dual (my previous phone)Battery Charging: first 30-40% is very quick in charging. But to get it fully charged it takes almost an hour.Battery Life: It runs for more than 24 hours once fully charged even if you use it to watch movies and games.Negative : phone gets heated up while charging if you leave it on cushion type surfaces like bed, sofa etc. Irrespective of the surface phone gets a little bit heated up every time you charge it. And if you try answering a call or use the phone while on charge get ready for hand and ear burning sensation.This is not observered in Redmi 8a Dual. But the battery life is less competed to Redmi 9. If you are a person who uses mobile while on charge, then I won't recommend Redmi 9.Camera Quality: if you are buying this phone for Camera.. DO NOT. Redmi 8a Dual has better selfi and rear camera quality. Selfie camera is worst and rear works on in perfect lighting and when you try to zoom on objects it looses it's quality.Storage: Go for it.Volume: Good but when compared to Redmi 8a dual it's little bit low.Overall if Redmi 8a Dual is much better than Redmi 9. Except for the storage and battery life.

Second space is not there in this phone

I have checked it myself that the second space feature is not available in this phone. MI customer care is saying it has second space and service centre saying it does not have . I did not find any better solution other than returning it because a brand like MI is misguiding customers. The hardware is so downgraded that it cannot handle second space . So they have removed the feature from this phone which is available in each and every phone running MIUI. Worst experience ever ......

Never falling for cheap price again. I got it for 7149₹ at sale with extra 10% card discount. It was good for couple of months. Then it started showing some issues. I bought 4gb ram variant. Yet it got slower than my old phone which is 2gb ram. My old phone's camera is Front 2mp and Rear 8mp. But still my older phone gives much better image till date. My older phone's battery was 2400mah, and again Redmi 9 last only till evening, when charged in morning. Whereas my older phone lasted till Night with remaining 20-30% battery.I thought I was upgrading to a better phone, but no, I paid over 7000₹ for phone that is worse than my 5 year old phone. All the fancy features are nothing but gimmicks to attract customers. It's a cheap phone, that obviously have cheap parts in it. That will work fine for sometime but eventually devolve.

Don't get fooled guys by redmi 9 activ and amazon, The display as well as camera quality is disappointing. Their is very poor display with extremely poor brightness. Unless you switch it to maximum the display lacks brightness. Also the camera quality is extremely disappinting, both the front as well as back camera. Return policy is not applicable and only replacement is possible with same mobile and that too in the case of recieving only damaged product. Here also the customer will be feeling like befooled as once purchased the mobile, it can not be returned at any cost. Very much disappointed with MI as well as Amazon. No where they have mentioned clearly that the mobile can not be returned except for damage, only they are mentioning that 7 days replacement is possible making it dubious for customers. Kind of feeling cheated withAmazon as When I have resources available but still will have to bear with a lower end mobile whose performance is not at par just because it can not be replaced by Amazon. Not sure when Amazon started these cheap kind of gimmicks erasing it's brand name. No support by Amazon for this kind of performance/satisfaction issue with product. Think twice before purchasing this redmi 9 activ mobile. Only if you have budget issues then only buy this mobile. Because once bought it can not be returned. The phone is lagging in speed also. Their seems issue with power button too. Overall the quality of the mobile is compromised too much and a much better mobile can be bought at this price(6gb + 128gb) waste of money

Have you noticed that Redmi phone do not last over 15-18 months these days?Generally after expiration of warranty, if you update your mobile, chances are that it will brick your phone. Service Centres will simply say that Mother Board has problem and will ask you exorbitant amount to repair it.You will be forced to buy a new one.This has happened to me second time with Xiaomi mobiles.I am never going to buy a Xiaomi ever. Since 2014, at least 10-12 Xiaomi mobiles were bought in my family, Redmi / Mi / Poco and I had recommended dozens of my friends.. But no more.Xiaomi is over for me.

I recieved mobile on 9th August 2021, when open the box unable to power on mobile. Same day I called to support they initiated replacement. Delivery boy came to my home at same day. He tried to power on mobile, as I already said this mobile is not powering on. He started argument without IMEI varification I will not give you the replacement. My question is here if mobile is dead then how and why he was insisting. Did customer care support team have raised proper request for replacement. Carrier guy cancel my replacement. I called again to customer care I explained everything and they said once replacement cancelled. We can only refund. I accepted that preposal as well. Same thing happened here again when carrier guy came to my home same question asked for IMEI varification I need to power on mobile.boss if phone is dead then how you will varify. This things happen almost 5 time.

But i haven't used phone in wet hand at all neither it went into water. Pathetic service experience ever faced in service center. Then i went for another option of open market where they took 2000/-  and my phone started working as usual where as service center manager refused to repair and told me the expense will come around 8000/- to replace display as well main bord of the phone. That to we will not take any assurance it will work. This is the condition of service. Very disappointed.

","
Best Budget phone.Dear Customers please remember that the Price is always directly propotional to the quality.This low price model lacks Type C Charging port. There is no Type C port. Its the old pin.Sound quality is really worst.My sincere advice to spend 1000 more and go for Mi 9 Pro.

Worst Camera
","
Purchased this phone on 07/11/2021. Find below my reviews.Display: It is goodDesign: Ok (I feel it could be designed much better than current design)Finger print: Not facing any issuesBattery: FineCamera: Very poor. Most of the time the photo is blurred, especially photos taken in AI mode.Most of the people mentioned the camera is not good. I believe a 13mp camera is good for me but I never expected the camera quality to be this much worse.If you want to purchase a phone specifically for photography then I strongly recommend please go with some other phones.Reason behind why I chose Redmi is, Last Diwali I purchased a Samsung Galaxy 31 for 16,000 during the great Indian festival. But within a year there was an issue with the motherboard. So I don't want to put more pennies on my phone.

Very disappointing
","
I know this is a budget phone and one cannot have much expectations but performance is really poor. It's laggy right from unboxing, internet is slower on this phone, pages don't load as quick and the phone cannot multi task.In fact I'm having serious doubts if the product I have received is new. Its easy to factory reset and present the phone as new and even easier to re-seal the phone box. Amazon needs to look into this. This is NOT how a brand new phone, however budget, should be performing.

Apart from inbuilt annoying ads this is a good phone for the teens
","
This is high end budget phone that is packed with features. It is ideal for teens and students. Has a very good screen, good battery life and camera although not high end but does the job.The major flaw in this phone is annoying pop up ads. Although I tried every trick in the book to stop them but still got ads and that was super annoying. May teens know how to completely shut them off but for me it was a too much hassle.Finally I had to give away the phone to someone else.

Redmi 9 review.
","
Fast Fingerprint reader, large and clear screen, huge battery, overall well built. I choose this for my girlfriend, she doesn't play heavy games, for that matter she doesn't play any games on smartphons, so the Helio G35 with 4gb ram and 64gb storage is more then enough for her Facebook insta, and the 6.57inch HD display is also great for her nonstop Netflix and other media consumptions. She actually needed a phone with big screen and finger print security. Plus good battery life and no lags. So redmi 9 was a great gift for her. I myself use Realme x2pro because I'm a heavy user so that super amoled fhd+ 90hz display is a sureshot nessesity for me and a phone with the Snapdragon 855+ processer was what I was looking for under 35k.  First I thought to buy her some similar phone but than I thought why? She don't need that much powerful phone, so I gave her exactly what she needed. Huge screen, huge battery, good camera decent processer, 4gb ram. For her multitasking and 64gb storage for all her photos songs and videos and yea it has option for expanding the memory too which my phone doesn't have so I have to stick to the 128gb only.

i bought this phone for my mother, she mainly uses it for calling and zoom meetings of her religious seminars from indians around the world. battery life was my great concern but this phone does its job, she gets by with 18 to 26% battery life remaining by time its time for dinner in the evening.Fingerprint reader is not so great, I will give it a 2/5 rating. it often fails to recognise fingers, even mine.

I am writing this review after using this phone for 3 months.The phone boasts of 6GB RAM & 128GB internal memory but it hangs terribly. Some apps perform very slow on this phone. Another major problem is it overheats a lot after using for few mins. Its comes with an oudated Android 9 OS which I forgot to check while purchasing it. Even though its OS is upgraded to Android 10 there is no improvement in the performance of the phone. Even the touch sensors don't respond sometimes which is very annoying. If you are doing trading on your smartphone please avoid this phone. Buy n sell in trading is too much time taking on this phone. Trading apps don't perform well on this app. Finger print recognition is good. Overall this phone is not suitable for people who use many apps.

Since it's an electronic device, it's better to write down in systemic manner.Pros :• Easy UI with smooth performance up to moderate usage.• Slim design with quite the catchy look.• Finger print sensor and face recognition is better than other phones in same price range.• Feels sturdy and can withstand significant amount of physical stress if applied to.Cons :• Camera quality is the worst comapred to others.• Battery drains up quickly.• Sometimes with heavy usage, it lags in between which can be annoying at times.I only bought it because I was getting 5K off on exchange offer and my dad was going to use this one. So it's perfect for him.

It is a very good mobile for regular use. It has a 4230mAh battery which can give a day and more battery life if it is fully charged. It's eye protection is too good. Camera is in my satisfaction. It's HDR mode is ausum.After 5 months of use I have faced only a problem with its display. Display is not up to the mark. It is not so smooth. When a notification comes it breaks up. Otherwise it is perfect for daily use.

Good phone but not for Airtel!

This phone is worth for the price. But if you are an airtel user, then this phone does not help!! When signal is low, it does not work only for airtel sims. The opposite person was not able to hear my voice!! I checked with other phones for the same simcard and did not experience the same. I even ordered a new sim and tried. Didn't work. Strange!! So definitely it's not the network issue. Think before buying! Camera is fine but not great. Otherwise it's good for normal user.

It's a good quality phone at an affordable price. Works absolutely fine for me. It's as fast as a 6GB RAM phone should be. The big screen also allows ease of app browing for IG or articles or e-books. The camera is also pretty okay. If you were hoping for an amazing cam at this price, well you're obviously going to be disappointed. It's very lightweight and thinner than I expected. While the phone already has a gorilla screen guard on it, I'll probably get another screen protector cos it is so light that I am definitely going to drop it at some point.

Inbuilt apps nag you to opt for them and replace google apps. Google drive can't sync with them.
","
This Chinese gadget seems to be in too much of a hurry to unsuccessfully replace google apps with its own pathetic apps. It doesn't allow apps like chrome and messaging app to function properly. Finding difficult to save content to google drive because its inbuilt apps don't sync with the drive. Insists on using its own inbuilt apps and cloud storage. I think that the Chinese gadgets should be content with the profits they can make from hardware expertise, and not try to forcibly meddle with the software part of gadgets. I have another brand of China made tablet but it doesn't force me to change my choices. But I found Oppo very irritating. Anyway, hardware part, so far is okay. I got this mobile about ten days ago.

I am writing this review after using this phone for more than a year. Phone is working fine no issue with it at all. There are few things which I want to point out, first it's camera quality is not good enough for the price. Also the asthetically it's not very much apealing, oppo could have done better job in designing and selecting a better quality materials for it in this price range. But to sum it up this is very reliable phone I have not got any heating or lagging issue in it even after continuesly using internet on it for 16-18 hours daily.

This phone is a big disappointment. Not sure if I was  the unlucky one to get a bad piece but my Redmi which I exchanged for this one, I rough used for more than 5 years and worked seamlessly. This one had good reviews hence bought it. Its been a month and I am struggling with the screen that just calls random numbers, sometimes the call logs are blank, whatsapp does not work properly, it sometimes forces me to take a pic before I can even get the home screen. Paying for anything on the mobile is a nightmare, payment screens disappear each time I switch to the messages for OTP. I mean the list is endless. I am disappointed and kick myself for this poor error in judgement. Anyway Beware of this product.

Confused? Read on! One stop review for your flagship purchase.

I went through a lot of reviews and articles before I decided on the iPhone 12. I’ve been an Android user all my life and frankly thought Apple phones were really overpriced(at least here in India). But in the present day, the flagship Android options are no less expensive. If you spend a lot of time on your mobile, using it as your primary camera, social media device, business emails/collaboration and also to stream videos then you definitely need to spend a little more and go with a flagship option for the best experience.Coming to the flagships today (Aug2021),  apart from the iPhone we have Samsung Galaxy S21/+/ultra, Oneplus 9 pro, Vivo x60 pro+, mi 11ultra.  If you read a few reviews you’ll understand that 888Snapdragon has a lot of heating issues  and 9pro cameras didn’t live up to the hype(also overheating when the camera is in use). Samsung in India ships the phone with exynos2100 which is way less powerful than 888. The prices of all these phones are in the same range (except the ultra). Imp note: iOS updates are across iPhone devices unlike the android updates.Apple has really done a lot of things right on the iPhone12:1. They changed its display from lcd to led (huge value jump)2. A14 Bionic chip is a really fast and smooth without any lag3. Huge improvement on the primary cameras. Still the best video recording phone in the market and the photos are top quality4. The change is the body design is really comfortable in the hand5. The haptics are spot onWhat’s Missing: (Minor misses though)1. The Notch. Really wish they get rid of the notch but looks like it wont be out until 2023. Anyway you’ll get used to it.2. USB type C charging. The iPad Pro 2020 model onwards already comes with the TypeC usb charging. I guess the iPhone 13 would get this change3. Fingerprint Sensor: Yes. Apple had done away with it couple of years back but with the pandemic still on, you sometimes wish there was a fingerprint sensorWait for the iPhone 13 or go with the 12:It took a while for 12’s prices to fall.  If you’re willing to wait till Feb-March 2022 for a good deal then wait for the 13. If you want to change it now, go with the 12.64GB or 128GB:The difference is around ₹6000.  64GB if you don’t play too many games and keep dumping the media files every once in while to your pc/storage . Else, the 128😊Battery:I was indeed very surprised with the battery life. Charging time is a little slower compared to  it’s competition but the back up is impressive. It easily lasts a day.Android Flagship Option:The truth is, right now is not a good time to purchase an android flagship. If you really want to buy an android flagship, do wait for a while. 895 snapdragon phones are expected to be out by end of the year or early 2022.Hope this review helped :)Update:13 gets a better cam sensor, a15 bionic, 10% bigger battery and a slightly smaller notch. That’s it. No more differences. Everything else remains the same.iPhone 13 launched at 80k which is lesser than 12’s launch price(86k).  If you want to save on some cash , 12 will still  do the job (12 is currently around 55k-62k).  However if you can spend that extra 20k, then 13 should be your pick.Planning on taking an Android? Definitely wait until early 2022.

I am writing this after a week of my usage with this iPhone 12. I have had the X before and OnePlus 6T as well.Overall experience of switching to iOS again is so good. The Interface, the speed, smoothness, camera, support, and everything is so well crafter.I’ll be talking about the pros and cons with respect to the apple standards of course.Pros:1. The design is absolutely wonderful, its very very light weight and premium feeling phone with vintage boxy look.2. The speed, the performance.3. Camera of course. The normal picture comes out pretty good, they don’t usually need any professional touch.4. Battery life - I’ll talk about the battery life in day to day life instead of nerdy Screen On Time. I am a doctor and usually don’t play much games on this but I surf web a lot, youtube videos, social media and a lot of WhatsApp and sometimes heavy use for 10% of the time. It can get through one day pretty easily with around 8-9 hr Screen on time, 10hr Stand by time, so you can relate now. Don’t believe that it has bad battery, it has a pretty good battery.ConsNothing much until now.The back of the phone is fingerprint magnet, attracts a lot of them.Another concern was the charging adapter which is not provided in the box.

Perfect replacement for a long time android user

Okay I NEED TO CLEAR a few misconceptions about this phone because i am seeing a lot of negative reviews here which are not true, probably from IOS haters. I have been an android user since 2014 when I got my first phone, after many years i switched to Apple after complaining about their high prices  because i was disappointed with Samsung using Exynos processors for their flagship phones in India which causes heating, and Oneplus throwing one cheap model after another every six months.And trust me guys its amazing. The software is butter smooth, i might never go back to android again.  FIRST OF ALL - who said the battery life is bad? I got my phone at 70 percent charge at 2 pm and after 24 hours it was 20 percent EVEN AFTER I KEPT MY DATA PACK ON THE WHOLE TIME.SECONDLY- why are so many guys reviewing the phone on basis of the charger? everyone knows iphone 12 comes without an adapter. did you people not do your research before buying?THIRD - the 60 Hz thing does not matter at all, flipping screen is  real quick u wont even notice the difference from a 120 Hz in androidand lastly - the AI is so sharp, be it the camera which automatically detects low light or even the face recognition.overall this phone is worth the high price. i will definitely be using it for 4-5 years. a happy customer here

For first time iPhone Users
","
When the iPhone 11 prices were announced, I was in a dilemma whether to go for the 11 or wait for 12. And since it was my first iPhone, I thought why not get the 12. The logic being: The phone will last for a couple of years (provided you don't drop it often), and if you are looking for a phone for a long time horizon, then go for the 12. This one with the better chip and the display will be able to handle the upcoming updates as well the apps which will get even more intensive in the future.All technical specs are really good, display is an OLED one, even visible in extreme sunlight. Build quality is miles apart, my brother uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, and holding this one is way way out of the leagues of all the android phones. Processor and RAM are capable of even running multiple intensive applications, I had Adobe LightRoom, iMovie, and a couple of apps open, all to slide between them seamlessly. The trick here is that since apps are only made for a very few iPhones and iOS versions, these apps are hardware integrated, hence work better. A classic example is Instagram. Instagram does feel a bit more polished on the iPhone than android. FaceID even works when there's no light, so thats that. But it can't identify you with the mask, you're left to the PIN when you're in the outside.The Battery: Yes it has a smaller battery, yes with intensive use it will run out in a day, but if you are a bit prudent with it, it'll definitely last for more than a day. I use 4G in between, outdoor photography a bit, editing, email, Apple Music, Youtube, WhatsApp and Instagram. By the end of the day (7:00 PM) , I usually have 40 percent remaining.So yes, its an iPhone and yes its really something nice to hold and use daily.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 Battery backup is worst. My 2 year old redmi note7 pro (12k) easily runs one  full day with more than 4 hour screen on time. But this new 60k phone almost dies with 2 hour Amazon music. Clearly not worth it. Apart from the 12mp ultra wide camera nothing else is impressive in this comparing to my old phone.  Updated to the latest iOS version. Running in low power mode. Still battery is draining. Since the replacement period is over, totally devastated. To conclude never buy an iPhone ever again. In video Battery charged to 96%. But after restarting the phone it shows 100%.

I am writing this after a week of my usage with this iPhone 12. I have had the X before and OnePlus 6T as well.Overall experience of switching to iOS again is so good. The Interface, the speed, smoothness, camera, support, and everything is so well crafter.I’ll be talking about the pros and cons with respect to the apple standards of course.Pros:1. The design is absolutely wonderful, its very very light weight and premium feeling phone with vintage boxy look.2. The speed, the performance.3. Camera of course. The normal picture comes out pretty good, they don’t usually need any professional touch.4. Battery life - I’ll talk about the battery life in day to day life instead of nerdy Screen On Time. I am a doctor and usually don’t play much games on this but I surf web a lot, youtube videos, social media and a lot of WhatsApp and sometimes heavy use for 10% of the time. It can get through one day pretty easily with around 8-9 hr Screen on time, 10hr Stand by time, so you can relate now. Don’t believe that it has bad battery, it has a pretty good battery.ConsNothing much until now.The back of the phone is fingerprint magnet, attracts a lot of them.Another concern was the charging adapter which is not provided in the box.

Perfect replacement for a long time android user
","
Okay I NEED TO CLEAR a few misconceptions about this phone because i am seeing a lot of negative reviews here which are not true, probably from IOS haters. I have been an android user since 2014 when I got my first phone, after many years i switched to Apple after complaining about their high prices  because i was disappointed with Samsung using Exynos processors for their flagship phones in India which causes heating, and Oneplus throwing one cheap model after another every six months.And trust me guys its amazing. The software is butter smooth, i might never go back to android again.  FIRST OF ALL - who said the battery life is bad? I got my phone at 70 percent charge at 2 pm and after 24 hours it was 20 percent EVEN AFTER I KEPT MY DATA PACK ON THE WHOLE TIME.SECONDLY- why are so many guys reviewing the phone on basis of the charger? everyone knows iphone 12 comes without an adapter. did you people not do your research before buying?THIRD - the 60 Hz thing does not matter at all, flipping screen is  real quick u wont even notice the difference from a 120 Hz in androidand lastly - the AI is so sharp, be it the camera which automatically detects low light or even the face recognition.overall this phone is worth the high price. i will definitely be using it for 4-5 years. a happy customer here

For first time iPhone Users
","
When the iPhone 11 prices were announced, I was in a dilemma whether to go for the 11 or wait for 12. And since it was my first iPhone, I thought why not get the 12. The logic being: The phone will last for a couple of years (provided you don't drop it often), and if you are looking for a phone for a long time horizon, then go for the 12. This one with the better chip and the display will be able to handle the upcoming updates as well the apps which will get even more intensive in the future.All technical specs are really good, display is an OLED one, even visible in extreme sunlight. Build quality is miles apart, my brother uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, and holding this one is way way out of the leagues of all the android phones. Processor and RAM are capable of even running multiple intensive applications, I had Adobe LightRoom, iMovie, and a couple of apps open, all to slide between them seamlessly. The trick here is that since apps are only made for a very few iPhones and iOS versions, these apps are hardware integrated, hence work better. A classic example is Instagram. Instagram does feel a bit more polished on the iPhone than android. FaceID even works when there's no light, so thats that. But it can't identify you with the mask, you're left to the PIN when you're in the outside.The Battery: Yes it has a smaller battery, yes with intensive use it will run out in a day, but if you are a bit prudent with it, it'll definitely last for more than a day. I use 4G in between, outdoor photography a bit, editing, email, Apple Music, Youtube, WhatsApp and Instagram. By the end of the day (7:00 PM) , I usually have 40 percent remaining.So yes, its an iPhone and yes its really something nice to hold and use daily.

Battery backup is non existent

 Battery backup is worst. My 2 year old redmi note7 pro (12k) easily runs one  full day with more than 4 hour screen on time. But this new 60k phone almost dies with 2 hour Amazon music. Clearly not worth it. Apart from the 12mp ultra wide camera nothing else is impressive in this comparing to my old phone.  Updated to the latest iOS version. Running in low power mode. Still battery is draining. Since the replacement period is over, totally devastated. To conclude never buy an iPhone ever again. In video Battery charged to 96%. But after restarting the phone it shows 100%.

Likes:ios- efficient and tidy.5G; Jio gives 4G+ currently to 5G mobiles as of 27-Dec-2020.The chassis feels different than rest phones in a good way.OLED display feels good to view.Usual iPhone perks- longer software support.Dislikes:Overpriced as usual, more so this time since not bundled with earphones and charger.Apple charger doesn't come with a lightning cable. Please buy cable separately, if needed.The selfie camera dulls the skin tone. Selfies taken via Androids look better.Here's my 2 cents:I'm using it as a secondary phone with OnePlus 8 as my primary.Please use your discretion.Thanks.

Product delivered on 3 Jan, today is 6th Jan 2022 time 12:08 am. Problem with the product that got delivered to me is it's front camera hangs a lot, there's no newness of the product which made me feel like I have been decived with refurbished phone. ( Though I am not sure but as I said there is no newness also battery backup was real poor, I still remember when I bought one plus 5T it's battery lasted for atleast 2-3 days without any recharging but this product that delivered to me either it is not authentic or I have received defective one. Obviously seller won't return the item so u have to visit store to sort out your problems with phone. I hate it.

iPhone 12 screen is a major bummer!!

It’s such a disappointment. I have been using iPhone since it’s first version.So naturally upgraded from iPhone X to 12. But the excitement quickly died down as soon as I saw the screen. There is a warm greenish tint to it which makes the colors off.Selfie portraits aren’t good either. Too sharp for portraits. May be I should have gone for the 12 Pro Max as it handles much better because of the telephoto lens.Hope apple fixes the screen issues soon

Upgraded to brand new iPhone 12 (128gb) last week and from very first moment could feel the phone getting warmer to hotter from rear side and heat travels from back to side bezels making it even unable to hold the phone during FaceTime or work calls.

Best selling phone in the world!!!
","
No wonder Apple makes some of the best phones in the world. Iphone 12 deservedly is the highest selling phone.I was upgrading from iphone 7 which served me well for 4 years, which I exchanged for this.The delivery & exchange formalities were smooth.The phone itself is surely an upgrade when compared to 7, the display is top notch, the camera is probably the best there is, the face unlock works like a charm, what's to say about the best phone, it works even better than advertised.The only problem like always is the battery which hardly lasts a day & charging time is also an issue, it tends to heat up a little while charging but with the previous experience with iphone 7, the longevity of the phone is guaranteed with the timely updates from Apple, the premium which an iphone demands stands justified with a superior product.Some people tried to discourage me from buying an iphone from Amazon claiming warranty & support issues. But there's no substance to such things. I confirmed the warranty & product registration from Apple, it's as advertised.Since most of us are going to use it for a longer period of time, it's prudent to opt for the extended warranty offered by Apple which costs around 16500 which gives us an extended year of warranty. Do remember to do this within 3 months of your purchase.

A14 Bionic. The beast in all segments

I have been using iPhone 12 from past 20days. Overall a great phone with best battery life, best camera and great display. The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It’s top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price.For the price apple should have provided a charging brick and earphones, but they have not. Currently Amazon is selling this phone for 73k which is the best deal. Go for it.

I had conversation with Apple customer care , they are getting multiple calls for iPhone bought from Amazon . Seems Amazon got all defective products from Apple and sold . When we go to Apple service centre , they are ready for service for this defective products.

Apple should wait for at least 2 years before launching a new iPhone.

Well they are a multinational conglomerate and I have simply purchased a product of theirs, so I shouldn’t be commenting on their product launching strategy. However keeping this aside, I would try to genuinely help those looking for reviews before buying, in a few simple steps.1. Go for it if you are going for an upgrade after  3-4 years, as it will give you some flawless experience again.2. Battery life is not upto the mark, I feel XR that I used before this had a good battery, maybe I am wrong.3. Face ID has got no significant improvement at all, again I think XR had a better face detection.4. Camera I could sense something has been done.5. Coming to interface and product performance, it is flawless, smooth, faster.

This is the first IOS device for me after using an android until now. No doubt the transition was smooth. The camera is superb. It has FLAGSHIP LEVEL CAMERA. I need to charge it once for full day usage(not an heavy user) while using internet. OLED display is superb. Being an Android user since start, I was not able to restore my Whatsapp data in IOS which was one of the drawbacks. Overall it is good phone but overpriced. You won't get charger and earphones. There is a challenge to try new apps as most of the apps in IOS are paid  with just 3-7 days trial period. There are other brands in market who provides similar features at very less cost but at the end it's IOS vs Android.

Superb phone! Amazing same day delivery!I have more to add to my earlier review after roughly a month of use. The phone is an original Apple device. It's smooth and quick, and it doesn't become hot when in use or charging. The charge lasts the entire day (I use it mostly for social media, web browsing and music) Face recognition is excellent. Battery health is 100% (check this when you receive your phone under ‘battery health' in settings) and to keep it that way, make sure you close all background apps while the phone is not in use. Play a ‘pixel test 4K' video on YouTube to see if your phone monitor has any dead pixels. I use the original Apple adaptor (which must be purchased separately) and the type C cable that comes in the box. Overall the phone is a great purchase!

Buy this phone if you’re are upgrading from iPhone 7 or older or you gotta have a 5G phone (despite india lagging in 5G race) otherwise there is no difference in performance between this or iPhones that came after iPhone X. It works and behaves like an iPhone no surprises and no disappointments.

So amazing, sleek and beautiful. iPhone!! They (Apple)  do their best! Good for upgrade from 11 and beyond models. If 13 or 13 pro is not in your budget then this phone is very perfect to fill the gap. In fact iphone 12 and  13  got no big drastic changes, look and feel and configuration. I loved it!! 😍🥰

I am surprise no body mentioned this on the review. I had iphone X previously and bought iphone 12 now. The major issue that i saw is the display of iphone 12 has weird yellow tint to it compare to older models. Just for the comparisons i have added the photo of my 3year Iphone X (left) and iphone 12(right). The white looks is much cooler in iphone X compare to iphone 12. Dont know if it is a hardware issue or software issue.

The performance is amazing. Potrait mode could have been better only If there was a telephoto camera instead of ultra wide. But I am ok with the ultra wide.

The product came in a complete sealed packing. All is working great. Works with Airtel, Vodafone, Jio. Volte is enabled as well.I am glad I purchased this. If not available here would have purchased from US directly to myus.com address and paid import duty. It comes to the same cost about 65k. Paid 71k here which is very reasonable.If you want to get a pure Android experience get this phone. I have no idea what people are complaining about on online reviews. The finger print scanner is perfect. I compared it with the one plus 8t. The one plus device detects when you even half press on the finger print scanner. Meaning it's not secured enough hence it's faster andbthe pixel seems slower. On the pixel half it does not recognised unless the whole finger is pressed for 1 to 2 seconds. If you remove it too quickly the devicebtells you it was too quick.Camera is excellent as usual. I don't have much use of the camera as I have a 4000 usd Fuji setup.The phone is not slippery as stated in many reviews.  Battery life is fine.Software wise it's great. Game performace is excellent inspite the low benchmark results. Pixel devices always have better real life usage than benchmarks.Speakers are loud.I basically prefered this over the pro model for the following reasons1. Don't like curved screen2. Don't care for the variable refresh rate. This device is constant 90 hz3. Don't have use for the telephoto cameraIf the above things are important then go for the pro model otherwise to be honest the pro is overpriced.Finally the kinda coral is much vibrant than in some youtube reviews

I ordered the Pixel 6 (Kinda Coral) as the other colours were showing comparatively higher price. Anyhow, with regards to its performance its a wonderful smart phone. I have used many iPhones till date and still use one. I was a iOS fan, but, one day I bought a Mi A2 as a spare phone which has stock android and after using the stock android I started liking it more than iOS. So, on a day to day basis I use both iOS and Android but I personally prefer the stock Android and so finally I bought the Pixel 6.Battery quality is good, not as good as iPhones, but good enough for a full day run.Display is great, and some camera features are fun in Pixel. However, some pictures are better in Pixel than the iPhone whereas in some cases the iPhone wins and the quality is consistent too.Sound quality is decent, iPhone's sound quality is much better.Some people complaints regarding the Pixel's fingerprint touch, I find it good and appropriate. If one needs to make it faster, then just increase the touch sensitivity.Most importantly, Pixel 6 is fun to use and there are many features which the iPhone misses, so overall if you are an iPhone user and want to switch to Pixel 6, just go through the reviews on YouTube and make your choice. But on a personal note, I use the Pixel 6 more than the iPhone. And if you are looking for an android phone then just go for it blindly and you'll not regret later.

After 3 escalations with customer care and 3 pick-up dates, the seller picked up the phone.

An almost perfect phone..
","
First things first this phone is not perfect it has its cons, a lot of bugs right out of the box but a couple of security patches and the phones running smooth with no issues at all, battery life lasts you a day although there was overheating issues before the latest patch. The finger print scanner is just useless sometimes, rarrly works, I'm used to entering the pin now which is a shame.The camera is the highlight for the product, absolutely amazing stability for video, sharp photos and just amazing photos that you've come to see fork the pixel range, no doubt about that, they've caught up in the video camera section where they were lacking, now it's a real flagship camera contender.Charging takes about 1 and half hour on an Smbrane 20W PD charger (no charger in the box), the phone fully charges in about an hour on a Macbook charger which is convenient.Now the Google features are the ones that stand out, the ui is buttery smooth, l, Google apps open and close like IOS, transitions are clean and smooth, So is the display the haptics are amazing and you'll feel that right out of the box. The overall build quality is robust clean and solid, the design being so polarizing is a head turner, I really appreciate the fact that it stands out from the crowd.Verdict: If you're willing to buy a phone that gives 10/10 photos 80% of the time, a decent video camera and really good build and design along with interesting Google feature and gimmicks but at the cost of a sub par fingerprint scanner then this is the device for you.

Like everyone thinks about the warranty, i was also worried but found out that seller warranty(techworld retail) is provided but product should be amazon fulfilled (would be better) and the second thing is about genuine product for which you can scan qr code provided on box and you'll get SN no of the phone verify the same SN within the phone(settings - about) if it matches then it is geniune and this is provided by Google. This is a product shipped from Japan. Product is good and used it with airtel and volte and vowifi works perfectly fine.I got this phone because I wanted pure stock experience(without bloatware) and except Chinese company. This phone is awesome except for few things like fingerprint reader which is quite slow. Battery is good(for me) and I charge it once in 24-28 hrs and my usage includes YT, insta, music, all together around 6-7 hrs of usage/SoT. Not a big gamer person so can't commit much on that but camera, UI, overall experience is awesome

I would say no but if you have option to buy it from outside India then go for it, you will not be disappointed.Firstly the Cons1 Google is not planning to launch it in India any time soon so don't expect any service from Google.2 it is bit bulky and feels handful, not comfortable if you like light/small phones.3 No option for sd card, so if you are heavy user of pics, videos or games the 128 gb will not be sufficient in 6 months and you have to go for backup somewhere.4 Fast Charging is not fast enough 0-60 % it does quickly 30-45 min but next 40% will take 2hrs depending on the charger as there is none out of the box5 Finger print scanner on the screen is little slow compare to others, but does the job well6 it feels little slippery in hand, cover is necessaryNow the Pros1 Screen and Display is good with 2 good stereo speakers at the bottom.2 Touch and feel is pritty smooth and navigation is awesome3 Battery last easily a day on medium to heavy use4 it has got very good camera, backed by nice background processing. Low light images takes little time to process though, but it is worthy.5 it has got 4 years of OS/security upgrades gauranteed from Google6 it has now got wifi charging which is pritty handy7 Overall design and asthetics looks premium8 it is genuine Pixel 6 and I received sealed box with phone unlocked so thumbs-up to the seller.Overall great phone, if you can spend extra bucks then go for it.

Every Android users should try stock pixel software experience atleast once!!

From my initial impression:Out of the box, it got some bugs bt doesn't seem major issue. With latest updates, it seems like they fixed common bugs like app crashes, mic & speaker issue, closing app with magic earser.Camera quality also become more stable but no macro mode. Video need more improvement. In low light video it has more noice. If u have someone to get it for u from abroad, just dont think twice, go for it. Paying around 62k, I'm still happy with it

It was my dream mobile (Pixel), so bought it despite having no guarantee or accessories available in India. Thanks to the seller ""deals of you"" for bringing me the device.Pros:1. Stock Android and its features. The OS experience is overwhelming.2. Fantastic Camera and their multiple modes which can amaze anyone.3. Touch is smooth and buttery.4. Looks is by far the best compared to any other Android or iOS devices.Cons:1. Battery is not up to the mark. Sometimes full charge ends in the same day if usage is higher than usual.2. It takes around 2.5 - 3 hours time to get 0 -100% charge with Spigen 30W charger.3. Fingerprint sensor sometimes does not work.

Was really waiting for this phone to launch in India but Google decided not to do so, I'm glad that it's available on Amazon and actually the price is just right compared to if you import it from outside.Overall an awesome experience, Looks unique and stunning totally a head turner and camera is to another level, I am not a camera person but still it pleases me to see such amazing shots this phone can take. Totally a W.

I'm in love with the phone. The camera shots, video shots were awesome, the Performance is good and fingerprint is good if u ask me. The display quality top notch with the 90hz display. Feature packed and unique.Some of the negative aspects are it doens't include a charger, so u need to buy a spigen 30 watt charger for it to work properly, other normal chargers doens't work with it. Battery life was horrible during the initial days, after the update it became 10 times better. Phone overheats when u use camera or do some heavy task. Fingerprint reader only works with caseology tempered glass, don't buy spigen with it. The phone doens't come with a case too. I just love the spigen case. I feel lot more confident to hold the phone after that. This phone also doens't come with warranty in India. So buy it with you own risk. Speakers are low in volume when compared to other OnePlus phones.

A true flagship killer
","
Despite the product being not available in India I was extremely sceptical to order this imported product from a 3rd part amazon seller. I was not disappointed at all. Just before I placed the order I texted the seller to verify if the product will be in sealed pack and not refurbished. And he assured me that it will be a perfectly new unit. And that is exactly what I got. The seller being ""TECH-RETAIL"". The product came in totally sealed package. The manufacturing date was very recent (March, 2022). My suggestion to anyone who buys this device from Amazon. Do not jitter. Do not hesitate. But make sure you contact the respect sellers first and query the condition of the product. Rest assured this is a beast of a flagship, specially after receiving 6 months of updates.

Received this phone 2 days ago and I'm just loving how smooth and lag-free it is! Whatever issues you've read on the internet related to Network disconnection, WiFi Calling, Fingerprint and many weird UI issues got fixed right after I updated January Security update.Camera quality is amazing as usual. Phone usage is super fast and Android 12's animations compliments to it. Feels premium to hold it.Fingerprint scan is some *milliseconds* slower than other premium phones but somehow people think it's a big deal. Anyway, I can live with it.Phone gets heated up a little during initial setup but I think that's okay as it installs several applications and syncs large amount of data over the network for the first time.Battery is something I cannot comment about yet as I didn't properly test it. Although the rate of decrease seemed normal.The only concerning Con to me is the Warranty. I purchased Kinda Coral variant specifically as it had One year Seller Warranty on Amazon. So far no hardware issues as such and I hope nothing critical comes up.Overall, I think it's a must buy Android phone if you want the to experience the Stock UI with Premium hardware feel and are okay with the warranty aspect of it.

I have saved my thumb print multiple times now and it still rejects my own finger print before unlocking after few attempts. It is basically a downgrade from any other phone in the market.

I am deeply frustrated after buying this product. I have been using OnePlus 5 and using Pixel 6 after that feels like a step-down for various reasons. I'm genuinely surprised how people are buying this in order countries.1. There is no Warranty registration in India, meaning there is no Warranty!!2. Google Charger has been out of stock since December on Google store India, 2021 and one has to buy a different brand charger. However the instruction manual clearly states to use ""only Google Charger or Google authorised resellers"" (a phone without a charger, happening for the first time)3. Device is heating up like crazy, it's worse than several other brands4. Finger print did not work for me after attaching tempered glass, I had to take it off5. There is no face unlock option, cheaper phones in India have this option6. Device is too thick and heavy for a flagship phone7. Touch sensitivity is sometimes less8. Finger print reader is slower than most phones. It uses an optic sensor whereas most premium devices use Ultrasonic finger print sensors9. UI is somewhat similar to XIOMI phones, whereas the sole reason I bought this product for getting the Stock Android feel which it has failed to deliver.

Honest review after March 2022 update Android 12L
","
Disclaimer: I was very confused reading first review which said phones are refurbished but I got absolutely brand new device. You won't see ""Verified Purchase"" tag on this review since I bought it using GST invoice which made it cheaper than abroad (My friend was in Canada and we cancelled the order at last moment since they were charging 95 dollar tax over price shown on internet)Coming straight to review: (Not comparing it to iPhone since an iPhone user remains iPhone user :p )Pros1. Camera quality is excellent and unmatched with any phone under 50K be it OnePlus 9 pro or Samsung S212. Pixel exclusive features makes you fall in love with it even more3. Design wise this is beauty with beast since it stands totally different from any phone in the market right now and looks beautiful4. Sound is decent enough to hear in a bedroom5. Performance wise I am completely surprised how smoothly I can do multi-task on this device.6. Stock Android makes me feel relaxed and no more annoyed with unnecessary apps. UI is lovely.7. Battery backup is absolutely perfect for me since I am able to use it for an entire day even after charging it upto 80% in morningCons1. Battery charging speed disappointed me a little since after 80-85% , it takes time to go to 100. You can expect 2 hours for a full charge2. Fingerprint sensor is slow but after March 2022 update, it has improved quite a lot and I am expecting Google is working to make it perfect3. Call recording is a miss which I wish should have been there since it is legal in India.Overall , it's a must buy in budget of 50-60K and I don't see any other device stand in competition. I personally cannot use iPhone because of its limitations. And forget not, Pixel camera gives tough competition to iPhone 13Few important points:1. If you want to buy transparent case, you can easily buy colorcase of approx 225. No need to buy 1000 rs case since that too will get yellowish with time.2. For charging , I am using Spigen PE2008 30W and it shows rapid charging3. I personally recommend Kinda coral colour since it's not pinkish. It looks classy and stylish

Intially faced lot of heating problem but after updates and week of usage phone got settled and now no heating issue. The only con is battery charging takes almost 3-4 hours with any usb chargers.

The performance of the phone is very good according to its specifications.I had OnePlus 7 before which worked well for first few months and started giving hell of a trouble in spite of changing the mother board.I bought 3 lava phone - lava Z62, Z92, and now Agni, none of them gave me the trouble as that of one plus 7.I will surely advise to buy Lava Agni for trouble free performance with the  specifications they offered - though it's little costly when compared to other brands in the same series - for the sake of encouraging India's self-confidence.If we do not encourage our own people how can we improve, our talented men goes abroad and make other ccountries prosper & become rich because we don't encourage them to develop their talents here in our home land.So this is an apportunity for Indians to encourage local talents and make our engineers & scientists feel encouraged to put their best efforts to improve their skills & performance for the bright future of India

 Really amazing 5G made in India Phone in this Price Range..Both Camera setup good, Display size great, Display is also good as per this price Slot, Sound quality & Clarity Amazing, Slight issue with Side mounted Fingerprint Scanner as difficult to place finger with Flip cover/Back cover hole, Processor & Ram best in this range..So nothing to worry about Hardware Configuration..Just go & buy...And I am not going in depth in terms of Hardware as lot of buyers given detailed review on that and even I am not finding anything wrong in hardware in this price range👌👍. But I am Slightly disappointed with Software Security wise and this is Available with this and Every Chinese etiology Brand, if any body has doubt can check & Confirm it...The issue is that when your Phone is in lock Condition it is not Supposed to be Switch off/Power off without Confirming the Security Code for unlocking, neither Should Aeroplane mode/Sound mode/Wifi/Bluetooth needs to be Disabled/Enabled in lock Condition without unlocking the Phone, Nor Should the Volume Button can be used to increase or decrease the sound Profile without Unlocking the Phone...This is big Security threat with Every Chinese Brand and also with this Lava Agni 5G, Video attached for this issue...That's why I Personally recommend Branded Phones Like Sam***g, L_G, No**a etc.., because work more on Software Security...These Security issues Play important role when somebody Stolen your Phone & you realises immediately and the person is nearby you & doesn't get time to apply more mind on the phone..then you can ring your phone easily as he/She can't power off it nor Disable Aeroplane mode or make it Silent in Lock Condition...This Feature I have seen in all above mentioned Brands...Since I lost 4Phones out of which I get back 3....But this issue is with Every Chinese phone, So why to go with any Chinese phone go with this only...And if Somebody don't want to compromise with Security and wants to pay more then go other brands mentioned above....Choice is yours...

Amazing Made in India Phone in this range with 5G Compatibility

 Really amazing 5G made in India Phone in this Price Range..Both Camera setup good, Display size great, Display is also good as per this price Slot, Sound quality & Clarity Amazing, Slight issue with Side mounted Fingerprint Scanner as difficult to place finger with Flip cover/Back cover hole, Processor & Ram best in this range..So nothing to worry about Hardware Configuration..Just go & buy...And I am not going in depth in terms of Hardware as lot of buyers given detailed review on that and even I am not finding anything wrong in hardware in this price range👌👍. But I am Slightly disappointed with Software Security wise and this is Available with this and Every Chinese etiology Brand, if any body has doubt can check & Confirm it...The issue is that when your Phone is in lock Condition it is not Supposed to be Switch off/Power off without Confirming the Security Code for unlocking, neither Should Aeroplane mode/Sound mode/Wifi/Bluetooth needs to be Disabled/Enabled in lock Condition without unlocking the Phone, Nor Should the Volume Button can be used to increase or decrease the sound Profile without Unlocking the Phone...This is big Security threat with Every Chinese Brand and also with this Lava Agni 5G, Video attached for this issue...That's why I Personally recommend Branded Phones Like Sam***g, L_G, No**a etc.., because work more on Software Security...These Security issues Play important role when somebody Stolen your Phone & you realises immediately and the person is nearby you & doesn't get time to apply more mind on the phone..then you can ring your phone easily as he/She can't power off it nor Disable Aeroplane mode or make it Silent in Lock Condition...This Feature I have seen in all above mentioned Brands...Since I lost 4Phones out of which I get back 3....But this issue is with Every Chinese phone, So why to go with any Chinese phone go with this only...And if Somebody don't want to compromise with Security and wants to pay more then go other brands mentioned above....Choice is yours...

I shift to lava Agni 5G from poco X2 because I need privacy poco sending my  data to china and I don't want it I compared both phones camera poco have good selfie but lava back 64MP kicks off poco. battery life much better on lava it's easily give me 10hr battery life on heavy use thanks to stock Android where poco screen on was  5.5hr .performance little better on lava . Lava has good display showing pure white colour where poco is warm . Lava did a excellent job very appreciable thank you lava 🙂

Proud to be using this product. Prior to this I was using Samsung S20+ but when I got to know that this is the first Indian 5G brand owned by an Indian company I could not hold myself from trying it.Technically this might be lacking in aesthetic features here and there but when it comes to usability it's just a notch away from Samsung S20+.Battery life is better than Samsung S20+, camera is okay, Speed is as good. So, overall a great product in this price point.Looking forward for some premium phones from Lava or Micromax in the days to come.#Vocalforlocal #ProudlyIndian

Am a Samsung fan and have been using Samsung phones for a very long time. But because of the bloatwares, I got really fed up and thought of alternative Android phone that is Made in India and non-chinese. So I bought this phone and am pretty impressed of the specifications- phone has huge memory, storage and speed at this price. So am very glad. Just a few things compared to Samsung - I don't have a dual messenger option but there is a way around (figure it out via add user, in settings). Also Samsung to Samsung data transfer is easy with Smart switch app so here I did mostly via cloud. Also it is dual sim but 2nd sim is either sim or as card(can't use existing card to transfer from old phone, so it has to be new). So remember that. Other than these, this phone is great - very fast, lots of storage(128GB) and 8GB ram, and messenger has cool options such as block and report spammers automatically. If you are in dilemma to buy new phone, I would definitely encourage you to buy this !

Everything is perfect after one week use.The only drawback for me is the width of the phone. Although this phone is tall but not quite wide, thus, still being 6.78 inch it still looks a bit small.Apart from size everything is very good.Nice job lava keep it up.If in future, lava manufactures 7 inches plus massive display smartphone, i will be definitely buying that.

I was a fan of OnePlus but due to high price and not an Indian brand I waited for an Indian brand with reasonable cost. Then I saw Lava Agni which fulfills my need and purchased it without any second thought.Good things - Smooth touch screen, fast finger print scanner, camera clarity especially potrait mode, long battery life and very fast charging.Things that can be improved - Screensize is lengthy due to which it's difficult to handle in one hand, bit heavy. Suggestion to decrease the phone length which will reduce the weight.I don't see dual app feature to use two WhatsApp accounts, some are saying it's supported but I don't see it available.It's time to prove even Indian brands can compete with Chinese.

I bought this phone because of the tagline "" Proudly Indian "" and on high hopes that this would be good as any other phones in similar price range. Have been using this for more than a month now and am thoroughly disappointed with the device's performance and regret buying this one.The worst part :: The phone has nil/terribly bad internet signal holding capability .This is best evident while using Microsoft teams. The experience is so bad that I frequently miss patches of conversation happening and I am left in a helpless situation unable to answer to my supervisors and colleagues in the call. This phone is a "" no "" "" no "" for anyone who uses Microsoft Teams in their office. This is the most extensively used app on my phone apart from Microsoft Outlook Mail. I am unaware how other meeting apps are performing on this phone but Teams is a disaster.Other issues :: 1.The speaker on the phone sounded very cheap as the quality of the audio was not in a refined state. I was surprised as the audio did not have the quality of a realme phone which I had been using for close to 3 years costing only 12k. When I raised a complaint, the service personnel collected the phone from my residence and changed the speaker. It sounds better now. 2.The volume in the earpiece is extremely low that when I am out on road I am unable to hear anything at all. Though I had complained about this one also to the service personnel, he could not do anything.This issue persists. When I receive a call while I am on road, I have to tell the person that I would be calling them back, then have to go to a relatively quiet place and call them back. Quite a task. 3.Battery drains pretty fast, may be because I use Microsoft apps but still the older Realme phone did a better job.With the above issues and at this price point, I feel I have made a mistake with the choice.

Giving this review after using this phone for last 5 days.Pros:1. For me battery standby is 2 days.2. Touch screen is very responsive.3. Apps open very fast.4. Didn't found any lags.5. Fingerprint reader is working well.6. Camera quality and features are very good at this price.7. Dual flash8. Videos are running very smooth.9. Speakers are very loud and had no problem to hear at a crowded road.10. Facedetection is also working well.11. Corning Gorilla glass and back cover which comes with the box helps to protect the phone.12. Awesome part is i received a whatsapp message from lava with dedicated relationship manager name and number.13. Pic and drop for service related issues are also avialable.14. Stock Anroid is smooth and working well.Cons:1. Only 1 con I realised is there is no dedicated memory slot. The extended memory slot is hybrid.If you are thinking to buy this product then my recommendation is go ahead...

Truly proud of my First Indian 5G phone.

I proudly say that Lava is an Indian company, not because it is an Indian company but because the handset which the company has launched i.e Agni 5G is above any other company's models or phones in the given specifications.1) 128GB Storage with 8GB Ram at ₹16400 is just superb. Camera is 64MP. Whereas the style of the phone is concerned, to be honest it really feels cool and lavish while using this phone.2) The phone charges really very fast. It charges 85% in 60 minutes, with mobile data kept ON and the phone profile kept on SOUND mode. May be if the mobile data is kept off, then the phone may get charged till 85% in 45-50 minutes. And if the phone is charged keeping the whole device switched off then it may get fully (100%) charged in just 40-50 minutes (I have not tried this).3) I used the device for calling purpose, extensively used social media apps like Facebook and Twitter almost for 3 hours, surfed many things on internet, downloaded many apps, updated many apps, also used gps for around 20-30 minutes and watched video on YouTube for around 20 minutes. So after extensive use throughout the day, the battery lasted for around 28 hours with still 12% battery left. That means the battery discharged from 100% to 12% in around 28 hours (Mobile Data was kept ON all the time, even when the phone was not in use). So battery backup is also superb.4) The touch is awesome and since the RAM is 8GB , the phone is working like IRON man working on his system. Everything is quick and in a flash. It works like Butter.5) The phone does not hang at all.( Till now it did not hang at any point of use and hope that it does not hang even in the future also)6) front camera is perfect. The back camera is something which needs some improvement. So if you are into photography profession then the back camera of this phone might disappoint you. That does not mean the back camera is completely bad. No. It is like, the back camera gives good quality pictures but not like that of DSLR quality or 4K quality. So for regular use of camera, the back camera is very very good.7) the box contains back cover which is a plus point.8) 100 days free screen replacement feature also available with Lava Agni 5G handset.So friends, you can blindly trust this phone, and can proudly say it to people that you use LAVA Agni 5G phone. Buy it and use it with pride.

In fact, as compared to Samsung phones, these people are providing a Travel adapter and surprisingly, a decent silicon back cover too.Phone is super smooth as it has minimal bloatware. Surely worth an option in this range, given the specs and performance. Would be good to see NFC in one of their variants at some point.

I upgraded from Nokia 5. Bought this mainly because it's ""proudly Indian"". With discounts and offers the price for me was 14.7k which I think it's a steal given the specs. Coming from a front fingerprint phone, I was apprehensive about the side sensor but it works very well. Battery is monstrous! I watched 8 hours of videos, 1 hour of video calling, 30 mins normal calling and battery still lasted for 48 hours! Also like the absence of bloats.My only complain is that it's quite heavy and large compared to my previous phone but I guess I'll get used to it.Overall, very satisfied.

I Got this Phone in my Hand on Jun 2, 2022as soon i Tested this, i Found Following:1: fingerprint:it is Average and, when Touches with Other Finger, it takes phone to the Enter Pin Area Box again and again. also, when touched with hand also, it does the same action.2: buttons: power button is some what sensitive. it means, when Pressed 1 or 2 times, then only it makes the phone screen to Off.3: Battery: it is Amazing, No Problem for that. it Lasts for me nearly about 48 hours on 1 charge when using phone frequently.4: Heating Issue: it has much heating issue. specially when we charge the battery from 0 to 100, when charged, phone gets Heated like a hot Coffee Mug.5: Camera, it is good only not like large smartphone but, it is ok only.6: Build Quality: it is ok, but i think when if the phone gets drop by mistake, it may break the screen.7: Call Issue:you have very much network issues with this phone specially i think because, it has only 2 5G Bands.also, when we Talk by Putting the Phone  on Just Year, it does not makes opposite person listen our Voice Clearly so, in that case we need to use the phone during the call by keeping it some what far from our year.8: Speed, speed is great, i use nearly more apps by keeping it open all the time.9: UI: Lava should update their phone software, specially diler, it has very bad function of recording, when we set our phone on auto recording, it says opposite person that, your call is getting recorded like that message.10: Finally: at last, my rating would be 4/5, due to heating issue and some miner issues. but, you can get it if you get it in 15000 or 16000 in offer but, 18999 or, 17999 is high pricing for this.

Never felt this kind of Gaming dominance with any other Phone.No sign of heating or lagging with BGMI (3 hrs I play yesterday)Itna clear display that I could see the enemies clearly who were hide in grassI have used OnePlus Nord and Mi A3 before but this Neo 6 is something out of this world.Design - Looks like a 70-80k Phone (Like iPhone 13 Green Colour)Camera - When Vlogging I feel hardly any shaky feeling in VideoCharging - Phone was charged in hardly 20 min time.

Although it is gaming oriented phone, i expected it to have good camera quality and sound at least.My initial comparison for this device is with my pixel 4a.Compared photo qualiy- photo came out better on pixel 4a (fine since it's pixel anyways)Compared sound - this is where I am disappointed, being a gaming device sound should have better than pixel at least, but Pixel is better here as well.Also, it was 40% charged when came and got discharged to 11% within the time I set it up in next 30 min. Bit concerned for battery life as well.At this point, I am disappointed with the phone.

Worst camera under flagship segment

IQOO Neo 6 has worst camera which is like a normal midrange phone but not as flagship mobile, usually this kind of cameras comes for 15-18k price mobiles. Quick charging is good but battery drains very fast, so battery segment also failed. And no security, as per terms n conditions clearly says that our data will be shared out of region as well (data will be shared to Chinese server).This mobile is useful only for gamersAs per my view mobile price should be b't 15k-18k.

It's actually a gift from a very dear friend who has been using a different product from the same brand. I just finished 2.5-3 hours of straight gaming and wow is the word for the overall gaming experience. Simply wow! I believe it was because of Qualcomm870 and 1200 Hz Touch Sampling. Good technology always makes me happy and am quite happy to be one of the first few owners of this powerful product:)

Honest opinion on this phone is that, Iqoo is innovating much better than OnePlus nowadays.
","
As an Ios user, I am genuinely speaking that aboth camera performance and gaming experience are better than 50k budgets phones of Samsung s21fe or OnePlus 9rt..Two of my friends have both of these above smartphones, but they got surprised by the pictures which got captured by Iqoo Neo 6. Practically they admired the quality of the pictures captured by my device.Never thought that Iqoo can outperformed those device but it really happened..Honestly speaking Iqoo is innovating much better than OnePlus or Samsung like smartphones but don't know how many day's it will be continued.On my point of view I will surely suggest anyone to buy this smartphone as it has no major heating issues,no bugs problem,Funtouch OS is really much better than I expected, battery health is also nice, Camera performane and gaming experience is just outstanding.In one word it's a killer smartphone under budget 30k which can also beat 50k smartphones.Apart from these Iqoo Neo 6, I am also using iphone 13 and I will definitely upload a camera comparison video between these two smartphones.

Every feature is jampacked and nicely knitted over the phone like:1. Display - Top notch be it colors, video enhancement, brightness etc2. Battery and on time display usage- Excellent3. Performance- Best in class with Qualcomm Snapdragon 8704. Gaming- Exceeded the expectations, no overheating, highly adaptive5. Sound- crisp sound with dual stereo speakersHowever, here comes the thing which totally disappointed me in this price range its the camera. The camera is not at all upto the mark, produces a lot of noise while capturing but after captured it processes it to look good but did not catch my attention . Being a premium mid range phone they could have really worked on this aspect too. Camera has some ui features that takes a jibe but quality of pics is really not what i expected to be.Verdict-- if you are a camera lover, pic, selfie addicts this phone is not for you peeps but if you are ok with the camera then it's a must go within this price range. Except Camera its value for money in the quoted price.

Pros1.Firstly the E4 amoled display is super bright and colors are also good,punceholed display,Indisplay fingerprint sensor and also as peak brightness of 1300nits very clearly visible in sunlight,one of the best amoled display I find it better than OnePlus ,oppo at this price range.2.Processor is super fast and software is optimised a lot and not even a single jitter or lag.3.battery charges very fastly and upto date of my heavy usage I find cooling system is working amazingly only heats a bit after charging and rest of the time it is super cool.4.Not at all a camera flagship mobile but for a medium users like me it's amazing.5.if your expecting a bigger screen size this is better than iqoo 9 se and iqoo7 more convenient space for keypad typing.6. Flagship gaming mobile ultra smooth.7.provide all the sensors even Ir sensor providedCons1.Not a camera centric smartphone.2.No NFC sharing .3.Iqoo has their own dedicated system utility application but only flaw is a file manager and pdf viewer it comes  with Google file manager.

I bought this mobile, i love the iqoo mobile configuration. This product configuration is good and it's perform well as what they assured us. But in the box i don't get the audio jack adaptor as the mentioned above. This mobile doesn't have 3.5mm audio jack hole , so they have to provide the audio use jack, but I didn't recieve any from the product box.Please Kindly help me with this.

Good Hardware Value for money Bad Software and Bloatware Not a bad Camera
","
Good Hardware specs with proven 870 - though an year old, discontinued by few other brands; great charging, Nice display, dual stereo speakers, Nice Call and data quality with good signal reception. Acceptable battery performance with aggressive power management. The IR blaster is a good surprise.The phone has come possibly with a preinstalled screen guard. A nice Tempered glass would be a good replacement though. Plugging  in my 3.5mm Headphone with the adapter provided was seamless.Can charge from 20 to 100 in close to 30 mins. Battery easily lasts a day for normal usage. Acceptable levels of heating with continuous usage for an hour.Boot time took a bit unusually longer than expected (may be the bloatware).Debloated most apps using adb shell and pm uninstall for user 0. This does not need oem unlocking or rooting. This is not uninstalling the bloatware, but completely disabling it for the current user - which works and is sufficient. Was able to remove facebook and its services, amazon, sharechat, mojo, default broswer, easyshare, google pay, China based unipay, tips, cloud, bbk apps, etcThere are two to three apps that you possibly are restricted from disabling.Using a VPN based adblocker like Tracker Control showed data hitting India and US.Camera - The main one is a decent one, the app is also decent with pro, sport, slow mo, dual facing options. The depth sensor is average.Would have loved a stock android experience on this hardware spec. Anyone spending close to 25K + on a phone should not be treated with unwanted bloatware.

Not for gaming
","
In earlier mobiles iqoo provided background calls feature while playing the games. In this mobile neo 6 they haven't provided that feature. When someone is calling you while playing the game, it will come out of your game. So you will miss your game flow. I bought iqoo mobile for this important background calls feature. Worst experience.

I ordered it at 12:50PM on the launch day and got it at 10AM next day. Super fast delivery. Awesome phone.You might hear reviewers telling camera is okish! Guys at 26k with 870 (most balanced processor from SD), the camera is really good enogh. Charging speed is really awesome. Within 5 mins, it charged from 36% to 54% and 50-60% is enogh for a day to last. Phone feels like a premium phone when you hold it.Dont just think, go for it..

I am giving 4 stars for only one reason which is funtouch OS the funtouch OS feels old just and sometimes resembles IOS, vivo/iqoo should stop taking inspiration from IOS and rather work on Android and make it more interactive. Apart from that Main sensor is good and processor is killer. There are some optimization issues which should be fixed with updates apart from that using this phone for 3 days and I am totally satisfied with the performance.

Update for flash message problem found on youtube:when a flash message comes there are two option ' cancel ' and 'save', click on save then open message app you will see that message on top, now 'block and report' that sender you will not get that type of flash message ever! But there is the sacrifice of data consumption messages, but I think this is not much concerned as the flash messages! If it worked let others know!=========Purchased this phone @17k after having bank discount and exchanging my 3.5 year old OnePlus 6.Phone is really good. I use it for general purpose like fb, WhatsApp, kotak, yono and office related apps like intune company portal outlook teams.- No heating that I noticed while using or charging.- Smooth onscreen fingerprint unlock.- installed many apps like practo ola uber. Everything is working fine.Only thing that is bothering me is the flash message. Whenever you get a flash message from your network service provide, it opens in a new window instead of showing on the same screen. Due to this, I am unable to login into my Kotak app as it requires you to be on Kotak app when it tries to log you in via sms validation. Kotak app send message from your phone for validation and we get a flash message showing remaining SMS balance from service provider which changes your screen from kotak app.This seems to be related to the funtouch OS as this wasn't the case in oxygen OS in my OnePlus.Overall good phone and I recommend it.

This is a flagship killer smartphone in 30k segment.

So it's understandable.This is not a Camera centric phone if you are more interested towards performance and durability though camera is decent no compaint. Then this is best choice to buy in 30k segment.Go for it blindly.

I am not really a big fan of funtouch OS,but it has improved. There are some bugs in contact saving and all but it will be rectified through updates. If you can get these phone for 26k,take it without any hesitations. It's the best value for money at this price range (26k).

Seamlessly fast, refresh rate awesome, camera is pro...tried and compared with Nord 2, front cam should be atleast 32 mp or above but this with added features for video call justifies the price, battery back-up after 3 days usage...of you use it frequently over the net or games it drains, but not that fast.... but again you hv that monster of a 80W flash charger which charges in no time. Will not say worth buying but yes it is a real worth trying...one can feel the premiumness. If all goes well with IQOO then they could compete with Mr. Dimensity.

By far the most average mobile of one plus

At this price point the camera is below average, non amoled display,feels cheap. Specs are average. Feels so fragile in hand. Sound output is average too. After using likes of one plus 3, 5t and 7 t, it is not at all worthy. At the given price a other phone have better specsEdit - the most buggiest mobile of 1 plus . Somehow out of nowhere contacts are deleted on its own and you have to restore it everytime. Secondly no matter how many times notification of apps is switched off, it comes on automatically. Camera is worst ever.

I'm giving a geniune review of the product.Firstly I liked this mobile phone because it is light weight when compared to my OnePlus 7T, it very much comfortable when we hold it and when we carry it. I liked it's performance, it's refresh rate and the camera quality is decent, I liked the battery life. It has a 3.5mm earphone jack (no earphone is provided within the box) happy to see in OnePlus Brand.Design 4.5/5Performance 4.7/5Battery life 4.8/9Sound 4.8/9Camera 4.5/5Fingerprint response 4.8/5Front camera 4.5/5Overall 4.7/5It's an amazing mobile phone, if anybody wants to buy a 20,000/- range mobile phone then it's the best I can say.Received good packaging from Amazon.in without any damage and happy to receive a good mobile phone from Darshita Electronics.Thank you Amazon.in and Darshita Electronics had a great experience.

The phone boasts of a sleek and lightweight design, making it easy to grip the phone despite its length. The fingerprint reader is very quick and responsive. The camera fairs really well in brightly lit conditions. However, the camera does take a couple of seconds to process pictures taken in dim-lit conditions. The processor is extremely quick and doesn't lag while undergoing routine usage. Not much bloatware comes packaged with the phone. So that helps save on the memory consumption and efficiency aspects. Truly a very compact phone in the budget One Plus segment.

I saw many negative reviews but still went for it.. Few points i would like to clarify:•For people who are upgrading from redmi or other middle budget phones i will say my experience is quite good in that respect•battery life- i fully charged, played an hour of apex legends n genshin impact it went down to 93% with a mild warm back and on a minimal use the charge lasted about a day. But with moderate or more use it lasts about 10-12 hrs which is good enough.•camera - not quite great that is you wont expect this from oneplus but in this range I'll give it a solid 3/5.• audio, video, wireless connectivity all seemed very smooth.•Design-wise it's not exactly premium looking but not totally badRest will again review after a month.

Even though we would miss the OnePlus’ stunning Optic AMOLED, the fast 120 Hz refresh would still give you a smooth experience. If you are looking for a OnePlus smartphone at a lower price (₹19,999), the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G is a good pick. You might want to see more options before you make up your mind.

performance and value under Rs 20,000. But is OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G worth the money
","
The 6.59-inch LCD display comes with 1080×2412 pixels and 401 PPI pixel density. The phone offers a 20:9 aspect ratio and a 120Hz refresh rate. OnePlus has tried to balance it out with support for a 120Hz refresh rate display. But that doesn’t take the focus away from the display being dull from some of the rivals in the segment. Coming back to the display performance, the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G offers smooth animations, all thanks to the higher refresh rate. Mind you that the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G packs a higher refresh rate than what we get on the OnePlus Nord CE 2, which is a bit costly.We had a good time using the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G display as it supported HD content on popular OTT apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime. The panel is bright and offers swift colours. Though, we have to admit that it missed the punchiness of an AMOLED panel.Overall, it strikes a balance of an inferior panel and a fast refresh rate which should work well for most users in this price segment.

Posting this review after 4days of usage. Device has a great battery backup.

As the Finger print is on the Right side ,hence can't be used using both hands and sometimes feels uneasy.2. LCD display3. Other devices that has Finger print scanner should be able to lock the device using finger print , but this doesn't lock.4. Screen wake up doesn't wakeup some times even after turning on in settings.Please go for it. Awesome mobile at this price and features.5.Finger Touch might be uneasy for left hand users as the touch is on the right

I see no reviews of this phone on Amazon so far. Is mine the First? Looks like not many were interested in this phone after all! :D As usual I end up purchasing not so popular things like I did in 2015 by purchasing Samsung Galaxy S5.I ordered my Oneplus 9RT from Oneplus Store app as soon as it went on sale because there was a small extra discount on old Oneplus phones. It looked like a good deal but when I checked the Amazon website, there were already card offers of about Rs.4000 off using SBI and a few other not so popular cards. I have only HDFC credit card which had no offers.But I still chose to purchase it from Oneplus store because I was getting Rs.500 off on OnePlus Band. I decided to try that too as I own Oneplus Buds Z (See! Getting into the Ecosystem). Another offer was 6 months free Spotify premium (not available to those who completed Spotify free trial or previously purchased Spotify premium as per their T&C. Do re-check if you are buying from there).Coming to the Holistic overview of the Phone: I LOVE IT BECAUSE OF ITS AESTHETICS AND OVERALL PACKAGE. And if you are coming from budget phones then this is a good upgrade. It ticks so many boxes. If you are downsizing from a popular flagship of yesteryears, then I don’t think it would make much difference.This review is going to be a bit long may be. I’ll try to keep it short and crisp.AESTHETICS:Hacker Black colour is superb! I just love it. Combined with an aluminium frame, it gives a truly premium look. It reminds me of the days when I purchased Oneplus 3T just for the sake of its Gunmetal colour. Wish they had brought that colour back!No matter how good the design is, most people like me use it with a case on it. Case is good too. No complaints there but I would say you will need to keep cleaning the phone once in a week because there is a significant chance that the dust will damage the phone.It is a slim and tall phone I would say than compared to Xiaomi phones that are usually like wide shouldered body builders.BUTTONS:I am writing regarding this because in one of the YouTube reviews, it was mentioned that the slider button was a bit slippery but with my phone it is fine. It is not as much slippery but does the job fine enough.The other buttons are great. Good feedback so far.BATTERY:Warp Charge! few days ago I plugged this phone at 7:30am when it had 20% charge left. I went to brush my teeth and wash my face which took around 6 mins. I came back and it was 7:36 am and the charge was at 43% and then at 7:43am, it was at 60% and that felt gooddddd!! Unplugged at 7:54am when it was around 97%.I would like to mention that when you connect to multiple Bluetooth devices, you’ll see the battery draining a bit fast but it offsets that with 65W fast charge. Works for me.If you are using it very moderately then it can last even a full day without any issue.CAMERA:REAR CAM: I added some sample images. I would say rear camera is good for casual photography and reels too, I guess. If you are expecting the same like a flagship phone, then it would not meet your expectations. But definitely good for its price. On good lighting conditions the shots are good. Zoom in and you would see some noise in the photos.Macro camera works nicely. But the catch is that you need to adjust the exposure based on your needs and it will capture some good photos too. I liked the Night mode too. At least the pictures that I captured in the night look moderately good.Even though it has the UI that is based out of ColorOS, for me it did not feel so cluttered.Hasselblad branding is not present in this phone. I wish they had it optimized for this phone too. Don’t know if it would make so much difference or not.FRONT CAM: 32mp would’ve been a good upgrade. Pictures from the Front cam were okay-ish in my opinion. There was a little bit of Smoothening effect on the beard and overall image too.Have been seeing Xiaomi 11T pro performing a lot better in terms of camera.DISPLAY:Oh Man! 6.62inch screen size with 120Hz refresh rate is a bliss coming from a 60hz phone. The usual human greed in me to get the best things in less price desired for a 2k Display resolution :D but this one has an FHD+ display. It is crisp and accurate is what I feel. White colour is a little bit on the cooler side than the warmer tone of Redmi K20 pro that I had. Overall, it is a great display being in the segment of FHD+ resolution. Good colours but I wish it had a tad bit of more lowest brightness level (for privacy and night time usage. IYKWIM😉).But the thing that I loved the most about my K20 pro was that it had pop-up camera and no camera hole on the display compared to this one that has a punch hole display with the front camera on top left. Got used to it pretty fast.GAMING:Gaming on this screen is awesome! I played BGMI and it was crispy smooth because of the 120hz refresh rate and 600hz touch sampling. When you play in phones with 120hz refresh rate and higher touch sampling rate, I noticed that, as the screen gets wider when viewed horizontally it becomes comfortable to shoot and view the enemies. Although at the beginning you’ll need to get used to the smoother screen, eventually you can score better than what you used to in the old phone.BGMI starts at HD GRAPHICS – HDR frame rate by default. Was able to change it to HDR-EXTREME while in the gameplay.The frame rate in HD-HDR was around 30fps and GPU was at 20% of its usage. This setting was not so conducive for the game play. Things got better when I started playing in HDR-EXTREME. Frame rates were at 52-54 and GPU usage was at 35-40%.Grass was rendering better as I ran across in the game. Shooting became better as well. Temperature hovered at 39 degrees as per the game statistics.Gaming at UltraHD pack and Ultra framerate resulted in 100% GPU usage and frame rates of about 40fps. I would say it was not as smooth as the previous settings and also wouldn’t recommend using it at that level because, GPU was maxing out.The ideal setting was Smooth and Extreme which resulted in framerate of 55fps and sometimes 57 too. GPU usage was at 60% most of the time. This was altogether a better setting for the overall gameplay. I would recommend this.By the way, I plugged the phone to charge while gaming and charging speeds dropped. It wasn’t at the same speed as you would normally see when you are not gaming. Even this way the temperatures didn’t touch 40 degrees (as per the in-game statistics).HEATING:I remember that last year some flagships of Oneplus had higher temperatures but this one has optimum heating levels while charging and even during gaming. It gets warm but not to the point that it would make a huge difference.PROCESSOR and RAM:It is a Flagship processor of last year so no issues there. 8GB ram does most of the day to day job very well. But some apps won’t be there in the recent apps if you play a game and then open the recent apps.I think in that regard the ram management is very poor. I guess a software update may be able to fix this but let us see. Anyways, apps to apps is fine enough.What else is left?My word document shows that I’ve written 1304 words prior to this line. I need to conclude now I guess.Hold on, just few more I want to add.SOUND AND MUSIC:I wanted to talk about this from the start. Speaker set up is a stereo one. It is loud and good.The real deal that hit me was DOLBY ATMOS!! I usually listen to Music at 50% volume with my Boat rocker 510 wireless headphones on.  But when I am low on the mood or when I feel like it is time to pump myself up, I turn up the volume to max for few minutes.I love the phones that can push the limits of Bluetooth headphones. This is one of them. I don’t know about too many phones but one thing is that based on tuned equalizer with DOLBY Atmos on, it gives me an awesome output in music. Some bass effects were significantly enhanced. Volume was higher too.Even in watching movies, it is so much fun. I don’t know if it is because of Bluetooth 5.2 or Dolby or this phone in particular but I am loving this part. Even my laptop that is 10th Gen I7 from Dell, doesn’t give out this level of output when it comes to wireless music neither in watching videos.Well well, I’ve crossed 1500+ words, so I’ll conclude here:I would suggest you to go to a Mobile Store and see what is important for you and decide accordingly. But for an average middle-class consumer, this is a good phone. I don’t know if Oneplus 10R is on the cards or not but it is definitely going to cross 40K mark or may be 45k too.The best competitor for this phone so far is the MI 11T PRO. I was not eyeing on that phone because I needed a change especially in the UI. I found the MIUI to be very boxy and a bit cluttered. Sure, there are customizations but I’ve been using that for the last two years and got very bored. The OS on this one is good.The biggest backdrop about this phone is that it comes with Android 11 where as Android 12 would’ve been better since only 3 software updates will be provided by the manufacturer. I wish they re-consider this.Comparing the Camera with Xiaomi 11T pro, I’ve seen it to be better than this and it has better charging speeds too. On top of that, it is cheaper.A good overall phone with aesthetically pleasing design is what I preferred. A friend of mine who purchased his iPhone recently, loved the black colour on this phone. I am sure you’ll have to be content with whatever your decision may be but it doesn’t disappoint.Phew! Time to close. This is my first phone review and crossed 1750+ words. Guess I should start blogging now! LOL. I will dream tonight about Phone manufacturers sending their phones and asking me to write reviews here. LOL (Again).Thank you for your time in reading this far. I hope you liked it. Peace!EDIT APRIL 1ST: 1.2k helpful upvotes!! Highest on my profile. Thanks you alll.

One plus has Settled
","
I have been a one plus fan since its conception and with this 9 series I have been very disappointed.9rt had nothing much to offer at this price point. Infact the battery life has not stood to its mark. It drains out as much as it gets fast charged. This has been the biggest heartbreak.Colour OS has spoilt the look of the interface.For optimal usage of the phone you need to set the phone on optimal power usage, which means it drains the battery even more faster. Don't even get one day of battery back up with minimum usage.One plus has finally settled and I cannot call this a flagship.... Infact I regret giving away my one plus 7,which was a much better handset in terms of battery back up even after 3 years of usage. 9rt has a 50mega camera, but in comparison with the oneplus 7 pics, there is no significant difference in quality.I may have to change my brand if oneplus continues to provide sub standard quality products. Sad but true.

Disappointed as OnePlus user
","
This is a early review, will provide detailed review later.-Should you buy it--the answer is ""NO"".-This is my 2nd OnePlus device after OnePlus 5. As previous OnePlus user I had a very high expectation. So, what went wrong you may imagine.Lets begin with the pros 1st-PROS:1. Looks awesome and feels good at hand. Hacker black back looks excellent in day light and very well balanced on hand. Camera module is also cool or better than previous OnePlus devices.2.SD 888 processor is very powerful. This time they throttled it slightly to keep the temperature under control and battery performance improved. You can also unlock the full performance mode from settings, but I would suggest not to do that.3.Battery life with 4500mAh is okay, but with your UI after few days of uses it optimize itself to improve battery performance further. Also as a previous OnePlus user I know battery life will also increase after few cycles of charging-discharging.65W warp charger is not a myth, 30-100% charging takes only 22 mints. Also for me phone didn't heat up during charge. N.B: I never use my phones during warp charging.Gaming also good on this battery, after a single charge I can play easily more than 6 hrs. Keeping screen brightness at 30% on avg. and volume low as possible, Haptics OFF . Darkness Rises is one of the games I play on this device.4.Speakers are loud and better than most of the android mobiles we use today.5.Bluethooth audio codecs supports LDAC and aptX HD6.Phone cooling system is excellent, never heats up even during gaming for long time.7.supports 8  5G bands over previous generations 2  5G bands.8. in display finger print sensor is accurate and fast.-Things that are just average:-1. Camera is not at per with cost. It clicks like a 10-15k worth phones. Only the 50MP camera sensor is good, it has SONY's new 700 series sensor more capable for low lights. But the software they provided is destroying all the details of pictures. I can take great pictures manually setting up the 50MP lens. But if you are some one who doesn't have much time to change settings between photography will surely be annoyed by this. 16MP ultrawide is on many cases performed less than average and without much details. 2MP macro is total garbage. My 13k priced OPPO F15 shoots superior Macros with 8MP zoom camera.OIS on 50 MP lens makes it good for videos.Selfie camera is 16MP and shoots pretty good images and the White Balancing is also better than the cameras at back in Auto modes.2. Display is AMOLED of 120Hz. Now that does not mean you will have a great experience like a 120Hz monitor over 60Hz monitors. It is better to have but not to use. I keep my screen refresh rate 60Hz to improve battery performance. the peak brightness as they say is 1300 nits , but day to day uses its feels like my OPPO F15 has better display.--CONS:Price 43000/- rupees means flagship in India. yet the phone does not cover any flagship features1. No IP rating. Means if your hand is sweaty, or you drop your phone into water or its raining heavily it might get damaged.2.Camera is not of a flagship like Samsung's.3.Display also sub-standard in this price range.4.Body materials: back of the phone is not gorilla glass, plastic or metal. so, no information on drop resistance.5.only 4500mAh battery yet the weight is on the heavier side(198.5g) and the phone is thick too(8.3mm).6.No wireless charging support.7.No 3.5mm jack for traditional wired headphone and amplifier users.8.Rest of the problems are with the software experiencea. Comes with android 11 in 2022 and Oxygen OS 11 which is a lie. this is actually less than Color OS . what I meant is that, it does not match with previous generation oxygen OS , its close to stock android and few things copied from Color OS, even bloat wares. Though I can uninstall these apps I didn't expect this on OnePlus. Also the features we had in Oxygen OS-10 that makes it unique are removed, icons and fronts are dull . can't even do as much as I can with Color OS-11.b. camera software big disappointment.c. gaming mode removed, means now all calls ,SMS, notifications comes over gaming screen that irritates me like hell.d. gestures are slow and not accuratee. still OnePlus does not have any AI like Apple-SIRI, Samsung- Bixby which comes with smart home & hands free features, but they think they can compete with others in price. If you have other smart devices from APPLE or SAMSUNG you will know their software is so much rich in experience. Here you can get google assistant like any other android device.f. in terms of updates OnePlus is behind other companies, 9RT users should get android 12 pre-installed and at least 3years of software supports. but they gave Android 11 and probably 2 major updates will come.9. Hard to reach post sell customer service on OnePlus after warranty, specially after COVID-19, but Samsung still excels there.-Conclusion: usually OnePlus mobiles' sparks are Price, gaming experience and software experience. 9RT failed in all 3 segments along with many other flaws. This device is not bad , but you wont feel proud after owning a 40k priced mobile. It should be around 25k.-My ratings of 9RT considering price 43000/- rupees-Performance: 4.5/5Build: 3/5Display: 3/5Battery:4.5/5----Camera: 2/5Gaming experience: 3/5Software experience:2/5Bottom 3 can be fixed with software update. For now my overall rating is 3.0/5--------------After few months usage i can rate it only 2star.Only 1 monthly security update so far..no android 12. The last update was on march 5th, which was a bug fix.In the mean time received 3 monthly security update on my OPPO mobile, which is low budget phone. OnePlus doing it to make a difference with their latest flagships. Which is a very unhealthy practice. Keep yourself away from OnePlus

I see no reviews of this phone on Amazon so far. Is mine the First? Looks like not many were interested in this phone after all! :D As usual I end up purchasing not so popular things like I did in 2015 by purchasing Samsung Galaxy S5.I ordered my Oneplus 9RT from Oneplus Store app as soon as it went on sale because there was a small extra discount on old Oneplus phones. It looked like a good deal but when I checked the Amazon website, there were already card offers of about Rs.4000 off using SBI and a few other not so popular cards. I have only HDFC credit card which had no offers.But I still chose to purchase it from Oneplus store because I was getting Rs.500 off on OnePlus Band. I decided to try that too as I own Oneplus Buds Z (See! Getting into the Ecosystem). Another offer was 6 months free Spotify premium (not available to those who completed Spotify free trial or previously purchased Spotify premium as per their T&C. Do re-check if you are buying from there).Coming to the Holistic overview of the Phone: I LOVE IT BECAUSE OF ITS AESTHETICS AND OVERALL PACKAGE. And if you are coming from budget phones then this is a good upgrade. It ticks so many boxes.

I have been a one plus fan since its conception and with this 9 series I have been very disappointed.9rt had nothing much to offer at this price point. Infact the battery life has not stood to its mark. It drains out as much as it gets fast charged. This has been the biggest heartbreak.Colour OS has spoilt the look of the interface.For optimal usage of the phone you need to set the phone on optimal power usage, which means it drains the battery even more faster. Don't even get one day of battery back up with minimum usage.One plus has finally settled and I cannot call this a flagship.... Infact I regret giving away my one plus 7,which was a much better handset in terms of battery back up even after 3 years of usage. 9rt has a 50mega camera, but in comparison with the oneplus 7 pics, there is no significant difference in quality.I may have to change my brand if oneplus continues to provide sub standard quality products. Sad but true.

Disappointed as OnePlus user
","
This is a early review, will provide detailed review later.-Should you buy it--the answer is ""NO"".-This is my 2nd OnePlus device after OnePlus 5. As previous OnePlus user I had a very high expectation. So, what went wrong you may imagine.Lets begin with the pros 1st-PROS:1. Looks awesome and feels good at hand. Hacker black back looks excellent in day light and very well balanced on hand. Camera module is also cool or better than previous OnePlus devices.2.SD 888 processor is very powerful. This time they throttled it slightly to keep the temperature under control and battery performance improved. You can also unlock the full performance mode from settings, but I would suggest not to do that.3.Battery life with 4500mAh is okay, but with your UI after few days of uses it optimize itself to improve battery performance further. Also as a previous OnePlus user I know battery life will also increase after few cycles of charging-discharging.65W warp charger is not a myth, 30-100% charging takes only 22 mints. Also for me phone didn't heat up during charge. N.B: I never use my phones during warp charging.Gaming also good on this battery, after a single charge I can play easily more than 6 hrs. Keeping screen brightness at 30% on avg. and volume low as possible, Haptics OFF . Darkness Rises is one of the games I play on this device.4.Speakers are loud and better than most of the android mobiles we use today.5.Bluethooth audio codecs supports LDAC and aptX HD6.Phone cooling system is excellent, never heats up even during gaming for long time.7.supports 8  5G bands over previous generations 2  5G bands.8. in display finger print sensor is accurate and fast.-Things that are just average:-1. Camera is not at per with cost. It clicks like a 10-15k worth phones. Only the 50MP camera sensor is good, it has SONY's new 700 series sensor more capable for low lights. But the software they provided is destroying all the details of pictures. I can take great pictures manually setting up the 50MP lens. But if you are some one who doesn't have much time to change settings between photography will surely be annoyed by this. 16MP ultrawide is on many cases performed less than average and without much details. 2MP macro is total garbage. My 13k priced OPPO F15 shoots superior Macros with 8MP zoom camera.OIS on 50 MP lens makes it good for videos.Selfie camera is 16MP and shoots pretty good images and the White Balancing is also better than the cameras at back in Auto modes.2. Display is AMOLED of 120Hz. Now that does not mean you will have a great experience like a 120Hz monitor over 60Hz monitors. It is better to have but not to use. I keep my screen refresh rate 60Hz to improve battery performance. the peak brightness as they say is 1300 nits , but day to day uses its feels like my OPPO F15 has better display.--CONS:Price 43000/- rupees means flagship in India. yet the phone does not cover any flagship features1. No IP rating. Means if your hand is sweaty, or you drop your phone into water or its raining heavily it might get damaged.2.Camera is not of a flagship like Samsung's.3.Display also sub-standard in this price range.4.Body materials: back of the phone is not gorilla glass, plastic or metal. so, no information on drop resistance.5.only 4500mAh battery yet the weight is on the heavier side(198.5g) and the phone is thick too(8.3mm).6.No wireless charging support.7.No 3.5mm jack for traditional wired headphone and amplifier users.8.Rest of the problems are with the software experiencea. Comes with android 11 in 2022 and Oxygen OS 11 which is a lie. this is actually less than Color OS . what I meant is that, it does not match with previous generation oxygen OS , its close to stock android and few things copied from Color OS, even bloat wares. Though I can uninstall these apps I didn't expect this on OnePlus. Also the features we had in Oxygen OS-10 that makes it unique are removed, icons and fronts are dull . can't even do as much as I can with Color OS-11.b. camera software big disappointment.c. gaming mode removed, means now all calls ,SMS, notifications comes over gaming screen that irritates me like hell.d. gestures are slow and not accuratee. still OnePlus does not have any AI like Apple-SIRI, Samsung- Bixby which comes with smart home & hands free features, but they think they can compete with others in price. If you have other smart devices from APPLE or SAMSUNG you will know their software is so much rich in experience. Here you can get google assistant like any other android device.f. in terms of updates OnePlus is behind other companies, 9RT users should get android 12 pre-installed and at least 3years of software supports. but they gave Android 11 and probably 2 major updates will come.9. Hard to reach post sell customer service on OnePlus after warranty, specially after COVID-19, but Samsung still excels there.-Conclusion: usually OnePlus mobiles' sparks are Price, gaming experience and software experience. 9RT failed in all 3 segments along with many other flaws. This device is not bad , but you wont feel proud after owning a 40k priced mobile. It should be around 25k.-My ratings of 9RT considering price 43000/- rupees-Performance: 4.5/5Build: 3/5Display: 3/5Battery:4.5/5----Camera: 2/5Gaming experience: 3/5Software experience:2/5Bottom 3 can be fixed with software update. For now my overall rating is 3.0/5--------------After few months usage i can rate it only 2star.Only 1 monthly security update so far..no android 12. The last update was on march 5th, which was a bug fix.In the mean time received 3 monthly security update on my OPPO mobile, which is low budget phone. OnePlus doing it to make a difference with their latest flagships. Which is a very unhealthy practice. Keep yourself away from OnePlus

Well I got it on 20th Jan, camera is disappointing
","
Well I got it on 20th Jan after using it for a week I would say camera is average 3/5.Charging is good it charges in 28 mins from 0-100 just keep the net off. Gaming graphics are average like 3/5. Feel of the phone in hand is great 5/5. But the one big issue is I don't know it's just my phone or others gonna see it too. I faced display issues like  color of the phone totally changed like it happens in broken screen.See the picture for reference instead of white screen it turned into half pink and got fixed after restarting the phone. So I don't know if it's durable or not. After this I asked for another piece and unfortunately I faced the same issue in that too this time I made a video check it out so basically it's a problem with 9rt.

Terrible battery.

I'm a one plus fan. I've purchased the op1 op6 and 6t ( as a gift) all from Amazon. While purchasing this phone I thought what could go wrong, Amazon is there to ensure any support is provided.I started using the phone and within a day i realised the battery doesn't last more than 12 hours on a full charge. So I reached out to the OP support, they said if you're facing the issue repeatedly contact Amazon and ask for a replacement. Amazon said theyll send a technician to check the phone. He came and inspected the phone and said there is nothing wrong with it. But you can ask for a replacement. So I called Amazon. I got scripted replies from their reps saying our technician is God if he says there isnt anything wrong we can't do anything. No replacement no refund. I took the phone to the OP service centre. They said if you're receiving 8+ hrs on a full charge consider your self lucky this is because of the number of sensors etc.All said and done apart from the battery the phone is decent but it's still not a one plus

I got this Mobile before three days. One plus gives google diler, but this is full worst. Call recording most important but this feature is unavailable in this phone. Call history missing. If one plus improve this feature and google dialer the phone become best. Other companies are give call recording feature and best dialer like vivo. Why one plus ban this.Overall mobile good but not best. Cause of Google dialer. After use of some days see further what's update company improvement.

An excellent practical phone
","
I have been using this phone for past 2 weeks and I found it to be an all round phone. Black varient is good looking and it feels as smooth as fleece while you touch the back.I was sceptical about battery life initially but I was easily getting more than 5hrs SOT while using it on 120 Hz mode. Also the standby time is excellent, getting around 24-25hrs easily on a regular usage without much gaming .Wifi reception and call quality are amazing in this phone. There are no dropped calls during this entire period. Wifi calling works perfect.It has very good stereo speakers (60-40) stereo seperation with excellent loudness.Haptics are decent and very well implemented throught the ui.Cameras are more than just good. Display is excellent. I didn't notice any difference between 8,10 bit panels when I looked them side by side to be frank.Software is very smooth and stable until now, I haven't faced any issues with software what so ever and it ""is still very good compared to other skins"" . I had used pixel experience earlier and it is as smooth as that if not more , which should sum it up.Removing headphone jack is not cool . Just because one stupid company has removed it everyone started to remove it . It's nonsense. Bluetooth audio has physical limitations and can never be as good as wired headphones. Moreover they are convenient to just plug and play if you receive any call . Asking to use dongle is like blocking your nose as you can breathe even through your mouth, absurd .Finally ,It's a very good phone to rely upon overall in the long run.

Ultra Fast charging 50% in 10 minsCons:1. No HDR 10 bit, no 4k in prime or Netflix2. Dumb speakers ... Very flat , not at all expected from 9RT model in 2022.3. Very low volume .. even on 1+ budz. You cannot experience quality music. You hear outside noise. Worst I say. Even 15k phone produces better quality and volume in earphones/budZ4. Message app does not seperate personal msgs from business msgs .. difficult to find important msgs.5. Stock Android is very boring and makes life difficult in 2022 where other UIs are improving from time to time.Over all not at all satisfied. I am a music lover and this one disappointed me. Will wait and see if 1+ team corrects them in coming update.

 My Review After 6 day's of heavy use.1) Camera - 9/10 Fantastic Camera Module. No Compromise Both in videography and photography. Very little colour shift in ultra wide and normal Camera. 1 Mark Cut For stabilization in 4k 60 fps it can improve. Slow motion video quality is above average I would say it's nice. I'll share some videos and photos. Photos are sharp and accurate colour.2)Screen - 9/10. one of the best Amoled Display enough bright. Worth penny and 120 HZ refresh rate buttery smooth.3) Battery - 8/10 . If You Are Heavy User you Have to charge it twice A day. Normal user can last battery for day .4) charging Time - 10/10 Super Fast take around 20-22 minutes to full charge .5) Performance -10/10 No Lag In Phone. I'm not gamer. I'm normal user. Mostly cameraHolic . So day to day task or camera use it will not disappoint you at any time.6) Heating - 7/10. Yes No Doubts it heats up but it cools down in 5-6 minutes. So This is not key factor to reject it.7) look - I Purchased silver colour. And Bhai I'm telling you, you will love the silver colour more thank black. This colour reminds you that you have premium phone. Camera layout is nicely design. One plus logo is Sexy. In display fingerprint scanner work accurate and fast. Display looks sexy and attractive. Slim body and metal frame make it very sexy.8) Delivery 🚚- 6/10 late delivery.9) exchange process - it was smooth and fast .10) Extra Features - there are very much Extra Features which will make you feel happy and premium. You will think OMG This Is Also in it. Wow.

There is an issue with 9rt model that phone becomes black while you are on call and you cannot use your phone . If other person do no disconnect the phone then you cannot use your phone and cannot even switch off as the phone will be having black screen and it behaves like the phone is dead , you can only hear the voice . I went to the customer care center and they kept my phone and I do not know when they would repair it , instead of this they should have replaced it.

This OnePlus 9RT has some excellent features but I am missing original Oxygen OS very badly.

Worst never purchase OnePlus 9 rt mobile

Worst battery and hang problem never purchased this productIt generally does not happen that I give negative reviews, though the circumstances have been forced me to write a one hell of negative review on a phone I bought.my review may sound trivial to this big company, but yes you cheat we people by selling your second grade of products.I have bought one plus RT amount of Rs 42999/- on 24/01/22 from amazon, from the very first day it was heavily hanged and battery backup was also very bad. Then I have reported the same in amazon and my phone got replaced on 04/02/22Now the main thing has happened, the replaced phone I found is also not working well and getting hanged heavily from the very first day and battery backup is very much low.  An interesting thing also happened, in the new phone I was unable to send any file/picture through WhatsApp as the icons were not reflecting, I called customer care no and they gave me a very unusual solution stating that just delete all text messages from the phone then you can see icons in WhatsApp….Eureka!!! This certainly happens. But is this really a solution or a jugaad…I had taken insurance against my first phone from Amazon which they did not transfer with the new phone.Now I am constantly trying to reach one plus and amazon to get solutions for all my issues but they are either ignoring me or refusing to provide me any resolution.I had spent around Rs 45000 on phone and insurance and at last what I got is a sheer pain on my head. Amazon and One plus will laugh on reading this review. They must think why this person is making such a hullabaloo on the trivial amount he spent. But look, we are taking a toll day and night to earn money from legal sources. Don’t make money by cheating people.I know that I will not get any kind of help from Amazon or one plus.I think it is my responsibility to share my pain to other people who are thinking of buying a phone from one plus. I urge them not to buy any phone from one plus. They only sell useless phones and their after sales service is pathetic.just please don't buy one plus.

I am upgrading my phone from one plus 5 to this one. I decided to go for this phone after doing lots of research. I had been waiting for the one plus 10 but personally I did not like the design don't know about one plus 10R but it too might be similar to the 10 pro and I feel the whole Hassalblad thing is just a hype.Its just been one day since I am using this phone and the initial impression is as follows on a mark of 10. Though I will update it after testing properly in few more days.Performance: 10No doubt the snapdragon 888 processor does its job very well in handling multiple tasks. The device works smooth and I did not face any heating issues as of now though it does heat very minimal like my one plus 5 did.Screen: 9The screen looks crisp and clear and I compared with my op5 and noticed this phone generated natural picture as if you see with naked eye. Brightness is more than enough for day to day tasks.Speakers: 9I liked the sound its loud and clear but comparing with my op5 I felt it could have been better.Camera: 8Although the picture quality is nice but it could have been better though its my initial impression I will be taking more pictures and test.Battery: 6The device seems to be consuming more power in any background services or something as I felt it drains a bit quicker. Might need battery optimisation.OS : 9Although its not complete oxygen OS but I have been a hardcore fan of it since its birth and even after merging with Color os I did not find any bloatwares or ads like most phone have which is really irritating. The UI is simple and clear and I don't mind merging with color os as long as the motivation of oxygen os remains the same.Overall I would say the phone is great and does it job as mentioned, you can surely go for it if your budget is around 40k.Updated:Using the phone since 10 days and found no problems. It's just the battery which I realised is draining quickly but it also gets fully charged in just 30 mins. Other than that it's definitely a value for money phone.

It has been 11 days and I haven't received the phone yet.It makes me seriously regret buying a One plus device if I have to face such issues, also I will have to think multiple times before buying any other One plus Device.Not Much support has been received from the One Plus team both Online and offline even after multiple escalations no result has been achieved.

Let me divide the Pro's and cons of this device.PRO'S:-•good screen and quality•lightweight and good in hand feel• the textured surface of this variant is good and does not absorb any prints.• back cover in the box is good and imitates the real look.• speakers are loud and clear•main camera has good details and clarity•alert slider is a good feature if you are in a meeting and wants to put phone in silent or vibration without looking at the phone.•call quality is good•pretty fast charging.•supports upto HDR-extreme and ultra HD- ultra in BGMI/PUBG.CON'S•potrait mode is not very effective(edge detection is not that great).• front cam pictures similar to other chineese brands. (Whitening)• phone is always a bit warm🥵 (888). But cools down if you are under the fam. (Never been over-heated though.)•Does not support 90fps in BGMI, where as the IQOO 9 does. And i couldn't find significant advantage from my POCO M2 pro.  VERDICT:-Whether you should buy this or not depends on your usage.If you wants to play games like BGMI or COD, don't buy this phone. Go for iqoo, which has 120 watts charging and better camera performance too. If you want to show off, buy the grey/ white.I have a slight regret on this purchase, must have gone for iqoo.

Using this for almost a month now. Moved from a 4 year old moto phone and transition was seamless. Loving the clean OS till now.Extra apps can be removed easily which came pre-installed. You won't find any issues in daily operations with software if you are a normal user. More optimization is required though in camera and os which i hope comes with future updates. They are responsive with feedback reports which i raised.Battery is decent. I don't play games and use mostly for browsing,messengers and YouTube. Getting above 7 hrs of SOT. Can easily last you more than a day if you are not a heavy user.Pros:Build quality is good.Decent displaySmooth OS performance.Main camera is great. Try Gcam for more natural photos in daylight (Subject to personal preference)Charges within 30 min.Cons:Macro lens quality is really bad.No auto refresh rate. Only 60 or 120 hzNot a con this one but I don't find aptx codec with my sony HP which was there in my earlier phone. Only getting LDAC. Maybe it has aptx HD only.

Pathetic experience

I was a huge fan of OnePlus sometime back. Earlier I was using OnePlus 5 which stood at its best no complaints at all. Later I bought Nord which was doing pretty bad and then felt probably caz of the base variant version in OnePlus it's behaviour is not as expected. Later on I bought OnePlus 9rt(12gb RAM nd 256gb storage), and this one is much worst than Nord. It's gets hanged most of the times with black screen, apps gets hanged and doesn't let u go to OnePlus home screen, apps doesn't respond properly and would expect multiple clicks. Pretty ugly experience i am going through right now.

If you have been using one plus phones for a long time, it's time you stop buying it now

I had bought one plus 7T in 2019. It worked flawless. Then in 2022 i bought one plus 9 and 9rt. Both hang so much. Heating issues at peak. Trust me one plus has lost the flagship. Only good things are cute back cover. Phone sucks totally. Never buying one plus again. Even after spending 40k it feels u holding a mi phone so why not actually hold a mi phone and save 30k for stocks! Good luck if you are still buying even after reading this review

If One+ don't fix heating issue, brand will be gone

I am not a samsung fan, but user of m51 since 1 year.Bought OnePlus 9rt 12gb in April 2022 for my spouse.First, last and only irritating issue is phone heating when just opened to check message and other for few minutes. Forget about games.Solution in all YouTube channels for this is low your refresh rate, stop all sensors blah blah.Then why should I buy a near flag ship phone.I am very much satisfied with my m51.Snapdragon 888 processor in one plus  is having heating issue? Issue with OnePlus integration with it?Snapdragon 888 in Samsung is not having heating issue(is it true, some people are saying)?My strong suggession - buy any phone in 25k and enjoy it to the fullest.108mp camera, 6000mah battery, 33watt charge, 32mp front camera etc, buy a worthy phone. These days even though you buy 50k phone, you should compromise for some.Go for some good brand , mid range phones.Do not fall in trap of specs or branding gimmicks or YouTube or other PAID reviews.

Before 9RT I am using 8T, I am using this from past 2 weeks, it's feeling me same as 8T. Not much change in this except camera is better than 8T, battery slightly good, also it's light in weight compaire to 8T. I thing is good in 9RT that it's side body is now aluminium type metal in compaire to other 9 series, have plastic body. UI also changed now, compaires to other OnePlus devices.Overall it's not giving me any special feeling that I am using a new series of OnePlus. Even sometimes I am feeling that it's same like 8 series. Can't say much about processor as I am feeling it's working smoothly as simlilar to my 8T.

Let's get to the Pros and Cons and end it with a summary.The Good1. Excellent build and feels premium2. Excellent screen and display3. Brilliant camera which has amazing low-light ability. The Optical Image Stabilization is a real boon and helps the overall picture quality4. Terrific sound with dual speakers simply brought a smile on my face as my other Samsung Note does not come anywhere close. Its sounds better on my bluetooth speakers and was thrilled4. Superfast charging and is an envy for all my family and friends5. No heating and great performance with the new snapdragon888 processor. It's a breeze in multi-tasking and it will stay relevant for atleast 2-3 years with 5g and great memory6. Incredibly simple user interface (I'm using Oneplus for the first time)7 . I have heard it is an amazing phone for gaming but I'm not an hardcore gamer so haven't tried much yet.8. It has Dolby atmos which improves the sound quality.The Bad1. Ofcourse, the battery.  It just doesn't last long enough for its 4500 capacity.2. It's not IP rated so one needs to be really careful when you are outdoors.3. Doesn't have a aux port so you need to either have to buy an adapter for type c to aux or just hope that its bluetooth all the way.4. No extendable memory card slot means at some point you will end up using the onboarding space and will be hit to a corner. I'm saying this after buying the 256GB model but with todays usage and downloading songs and storing snaps/videos I guess 256 gb might not last for long.5. The proximity sensor is not so great and if you try keeping the phone in between the ear and shoulder then the chanes of accidental pressure on various options on the screen is for sure.5. The dialing interface is poor6. The availability of accessories is really a big letdown especially the chargers and car charger. As this is a warp charger, third party chargers dont work that well on oneplus phones. Then, not only the company doesn't have it both online and offline but their customer service is totally inept in getting you any solution. So, if you need to carry your charger every where or risk longer charging time at some point in the day as the battery life is poor.Now, let me summarize the phone.On the whole, it's a wonderful phone especially for me to say this after having used only Samsung Note till date. Of course, you will have a small remorse due to the above points that are missed but there will be a smile more often because of this fantastic device. So if you are normal user then you might not face battery depletion as compared to gamers who might see the battery draining more fast.I would still rate this phone 4 ouf of 5.

Much ado about nothing - Oneplus 9rt
","
Guys this is being written after almost a month of using this phone as I received it from Amazon on Jan 27th. I was jumping from Redmi Note 8 pro to this one and I guess that's why I had high expectations about performance n the magic of snapdragon 888, camera developed by Sony n other Jazz. Like a n excited teenager I even had customised skin installed . . Lol.I must add here that this particular device might be with some factory defects or maybe they put 088 instead of the 888 coz by far it's the slowest damn phone I have ever used inspite of having more than 70% storage still available.Battery performance is poor n no wonder they gave the ""warp charge"" coz you will really require it.I did not try too many camera settings to check the camera option as I was already frustrated with its performance but clicking pics in average fashion tells me that it's as good as the camera on the OnePlus6 as I took simultaneous pics from both of them.The pros are the OxygenOS as it's the nearest to stock Android and one does not receive too much of junk in the forms of Apps. Touchpad is smooth but it tends to flicker while scrolling down a web page. I think in order to get the boxes ticked for being a flagship model there isn't anything special to talk about. I really hope my theory of it being a faulty piece is true and One plus does something on it . . Else it will be the biggest tech blunder on my life so far.My suggestion to the prospective buyer would be to either go for NORD2 5g n save substantial amount of money for a Oneplus lover . . . else go for Galaxy S21.

Broken proximity sensor hell
","
The phone started to have proximity sensor issues just in one month. What this means is that as soon as you make a call, the screen goes blank. Then unless the other person doesn't cancel the call the call will go on forever. Pressing the power button starts a dial to 112 which then ends and you get your screen back. The worst purchase I had in long time, stay away from one plus 9 series, sheer waste of money. Don't go by what the influencers may be saying, this isn't their daily driver phone.

One plus has lost it's trust and flagship status!
","
I have been using one plus for last 7 years, starting from 3t all the way to 9rt. I am not sure where and how OnePlus lost its customer centric approach for OS development, fixes and patch release. I am so unhappy how 9RT has so many bugs and no patch has been released yet to fix them. My experience post usage of a month:1)Do not disturb which used to be a great function, doesn't work anymore. You still recieve msg and calls ringtone even in dnd mode.2) battery backup sucks big time. The battery automatically drops by 3-10 % each hour. Even though I am using the 60hz refresh rate. Battery wouldn't last a full day if you use it little more than 4-5 hours.3) One plus has taken down good features and stability Oxygen OS has. The OS is visibly not that different, but on usage, it is.4)In display fingerprint was fast initially,but after 2weeks it has started lagging. Also doesn't recognise unless finger is placed carefully.I wish to not have replaced my good 5t with this  phone. 12gb ram and sd888 is just another gimmick and doesn't justify the bugs it has. I would suggest to go with some other phone.One plus definitely is loosing customer base, I am one of them.

Fingerprint sensor couldn't be configured, camera beautifies face and colors as if you've applied an Instagram filter (writing this review from 5 yr old OnePlus 6 whose camera seemed more raw/real).So instead of buying this phone for 43K, you might want to buy an oppo or Vivo within 20-25k because OnePlus is definitely downgrading.

 best phone for 40k price segment for oneplus lovers- best flagship killer- premium feel phone- 888 chipset, playing games on this phone is like 🔥- oneplus - oxygen os- but color os mixed but it is not noticeably, so no need to worry- 65w wrap charger, 😍, full charge in 29 min, very impressive- Nano silver comes with glass back, which looks/feels like premium- And one more good thing in nano silver is that we get aluminum side frame, even this made phone look premium- coming to camera it is good enough to take selfie and other pic- but it's quit impressive when it comes to outdoor pics- A big minus in cameras is - 2MP Macro camera, which will surely disappoint you😥- overall good phone for 40k segmentu can buy it blindly if your die hard fan of oneplus n oxygen oswhy 43k for this- oneplus-brand value, best among android phones

Nice ONE + 9

This is my fifth oneplus device , and i bought it after 6 years of my last device. I was owning oneplus 3 and oppo F9 pro earlier. I was a hard oneplus fan , bought first device OPO back in august 2014.  Anyways, i bought this as my daily driver and pretty much satisfied with this as well.Pros1. Perfect design. Neither too big nor bulky. Balanced size and weight distribution.2. Screen is amoled. But i cant see any difference with other full hd devices. Videos/pictures looks punchy and natural.3. Touch sensitivity is great.4. Alert Slider is very useful5. Battery lasts for a day after above normal usage. Warp charge comes here and does the job. 3.27% per minute is the charging rate which is awesome6. My variant is 12/256 so no lags experienced. Applications loads faster.7. Rear camera is a fun and takes great pictures. Color accuracy is also good. Front camera works great in lighted environment. In low light picture comes grainy. Rear camera handles low light very smartly and produces excellent results. I am happy with this.Cons1. Color Os - it says its oxygen, but its not. You can see traces of Oppo in the phone.2. Heating issue - it starts heating up on its own and cools down as well.3. Battery goes down very fast if you play games / watch videos on maximum brightness4. BGMI lags at maximum and ultra settings with gamemode on.5. Ringtone sounds are very low. Although normal audio comes louder and clearer.6. Sometimes fingerprint failes to recognize you. I experienced that with protective film installed. Right now i have a tempered glass installed and will updste the feedback sometime later.For now, i have this much only to write. I will keep u posted with genuine reviews.Final verdict - This is a good phone, if your budget allows you. I got this @31K applying exchange and credit card offers. 47K is quite high. 35-40K is the perfect pricing for the device. For those who want to buy oneplus device and with this much budget, i can suggest them to go for either 7 series or 9RT5G only. Do not go for 8 or 10 series.ThanksAmit

I have been using this device from couple of months and I found it really good overall.Pros:Fast Charging 10/10: Charging speed depends on outside temperature, if you are charging it hot conditions, it will take a bit more.Fast Fingerprint Sensor 10/10 : 99% accurate and fast in display fingerprint sensor.Display 9/10: Crisp and bright display.Camera 8/10: Good enough for normal users.Build Quality 10/10 : Flawless build, I am using hacker black. Provided cover is good enough to protect your device.Wifi and Call reception 10/10 : No complaints at all.UI and Software Experience 8/10 : Some flickering issues are there in couple of apps but overall it is smooth and bloatfree.Cons:Battery Life: Charge twice in a day if you consume lots of media on Mobile Data.Speaker Sound : Not so loud but okay to live with.Updates : Though OOS 11 looks more stable and feature rich than OOS 12  but still this device should have received Android 12 which is still not the case.Thanks for reading..Mark it helpful if you find it.. :)

I have now been using the phone for over 2 months now. I was an android user, shifted to iOS and back to android now.Gaming was never a criteria for me to buy the product, neither am I a pro gamer person, so won't be able to comment on it.Battery- on an average use (phone calls, WhatsApp, insta etc) pretty good. Can use it for a day with one single charge. In case you watch a lot many videos, it's good for that as well, but u might have to charge again once. 65w charger charges completely in about 40-45 mins.Camera- again I don't use it often, but the image quality looks to be of a better quality than iphone11 and below.Looks- sleek, sturdy and doesn't look big on your hand( depends how big your hands are).

I am a one plus fan and have been using oneplus 6 for past 3.5 years. Since u had some issues in storage and all so I opted for 9rt but the way the hype was created I couldnt find much amusement after using it for 2 days. Battery drains fast. Though you have ample of option to control the same. Charging is fast I won't deny that but still with normaly usage this drains faster. Looks fab. Cam is good sound better and screen is also good not that X factor to jump from one plus 6 or 6T to 9rt. Rest i leave it upto the experts.

Another solid performer from OnePlus

The Phone - OnePlus 9RT:Likes:- The new 888 Gen 1 chip is a beast, there is no game or app where it struggles. Multitasking is a breeze.- The display is superb and 120 Hz is just an addiction. Even though it consumes more battery, you cant go back to 60 Hz once you have used 120 Hz, I have it on a high refresh rate all the time.- There have been some complaints about 888 having heating issues, so far I have not encountered them. My usage is bit of everything, gaming, music, office communication, navigation, etc.- The charging speed is super, it charges within minutes.- I bought the hacker black colour, and it is a pretty unique looking colour. I love it.Cons:- For 43K you would expect wireless charging, sadly this is not available on this phone. Yes, the wired charging speed is insane, but at 43k you expect all the goodies.- Cameras: I am coming from OP6T and I expected a significant jump in image processing in 9RT. But it doesn't look like that. IMO the phone still has a very narrow window in which it takes absolutely stunning images, but again for your daily selfie and moment capture needs you won't notice this a lot.- Yes the overall image processing quality has improved, the main camera is great in light but struggles with overexposure, so the angle of the lens is something you have to play with. I didn't get the need for a Macro lens, investing in wireless charging instead would have been better. Some of these issues might be fixed via software updates, I am sure some camera tuning would happen.- Lastly, the phone comes with Android 11, even though Android 12 is out. This is a big bummer considering phones like the Samsung S21FE launch with Android 12. I hope OnePlus doesn't count Android 12 as 1 OS update against the promised 3 major Android upgrades, because this delay is completely on them.Conclusion:Yes, the three big cons are you get Android 11 out of the box, no wireless charging also cameras could have been better. But considering S21FE goes for 55K, this 9RT is still an awesome deal. In terms of performance, I am sure it can handle anything you can throw at it, and will easily outperform other phones. I am sure cameras will get tuned in future updates.If you are looking to jump from a 2-3 yr old phone like me, this is a great phone. Go for it!

I got this phone on 27th Jan and its been 3 days of using this as primary device. I must say this is a great phone in this range in my opinion. See there is no perfect phone, every phone has its ups and downs and you need to pick based on what you want the most. Like for me camera is not a huge priority, and this phone has decent camera for me.Also there are some reviews claiming on bad battery life, I don't know what these guys expect on a smart phone after doing heavy usage. For a normal person with basic stuff I could easily get 8hours of screen time without any kind of optimization applied and also not to forget the phone charges in a breeze so the phone has great battery.Second thing I have been reading a lot is no Oxygen OS its now Color OS, yes that's true there are things that have changed, and something you won't like but hey its still clean software and no bloatwares at all. People are suggesting Samsung instead of this, honestly if software matters, Samsung is crap with their bloated UI and ads and unnecessary apps. So I feel this device is still good on providing a fast and clean UI.Other than that I don't see any issue with this phone, if you love camera too much I won't comment anything since I don't use it much, but if you are buying for a normal usage trust me this phone is best, you won't regret buying it.

Is ""OPPOfication"" of OnePlus impacting the products?
","
So after a week of using OnePlus 9RT 5G,I am writing this review.Let's clear some people's FAQs.If you want ONLY camera centric phone, this one is not for you. Try Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G.If you want long lasting battery, this one is not for you.Now let's see what this phone offers?Design:- The first thing out of the box which impressed me is the looks and design. The colour reminds of previous OnePlus phones with sandstone finish.(But it's not)Not too heavy,feels premium,and love the screen size.Battery :- I must say that it consumes a lot of battery. For simple users ,it will last for about a day. For gamers, half day at max. Considering Snapdragon 888 and high end performance, it's considerable.But they resolve this with SUPPPEEEERRRRR Fast Warp charge 65T. The charging speed is way too fast.30 min and boom full charged!!Display:- It's a great display, colours are not punchy like Samsung's but not dull too. The 120Hz display is buttery smooth,but consumes battery. For gaming,the touch sensitivity and response was excellent. But most of the apps have not adapted to corner punch hole yet so,they fill upper line with plain colours.In broad daylight,you need to keep brightness at Max only to get average visibility.Camera:- Firstly,STOP GIVING USELESS MACRO CAMREA JUST TO INCREASE NUMBER OF CAMERAS.Huuhh...Coming back to other two cameras, Ultra wide camera is wide enough to differentiate and Main camera performs well during day light. But I am disappointed with the results of processed image s in dim light,(Yeah even using night mode) it is blurry, blunt images. Digital zooms are mehhhh.Selfie camera reminded me of typical oppo processed image, (soft,white,no sharpness at all.)Performance:- Snapdragon 888 saves the day with its high end performance speed and giving best experience while gaming (playing every game on MAX settings).No lag, premium experience I must say.Software:- As said by many, ColorOS with skin of OxygenOS. I am facing issues with screen off gestures. Although UI performs smoothly,there are many minor issues which i hope will be fixed with updates.So to sum up my review,OnePlus is no more the brand we knew as an all rounder flagship killer. Oppo is trying to add its own things to OnePlus, making it less OnePlus and more of an oppo phone. So the question is ""Do you want to buy oppo phone with OnePlus logo on it?"".

Thanks to Amazon, the device was received well packed and before time! The device is fabulous, it's like love at first sight! It doesn't feel like a 2018 device, the speed, the sensors, the touch is pretty amazing! A12 Bionic works well! 3GB RAM is sufficient to run the phone, COD, BGMI and NFS can be played without lag. Face ID is fast and accurate to unlock the device in dark! In low to moderate usage, battery supports 30+ hours and in heavy usage, battery supports 20+ hours. This one doesn't have Adapter and Earphones, but you can buy them separately! Bought for 43K (128GB) during Prime Day Sale!Overall a value for money device! A good device to start if you’re moving to Apple from Android or upgrading from previous generation iPhones.Thank You Amazon! Thank You Apple!

A phone with  a great Processor And Less battery backup

 Firstly There is no match for the A12bionic chip it can even compete with the new 5g phones  and iphone 11 too but you have to charge it 2 times a day if you are a moderete user then you will definitely feel the battery gives more backup. The XR only has 828 compared to the iPhone XS Max's 2,688-by-1,242 pixel display which means you can't watch 1080p videos if you run it on 1080 it will still show you at 720 but 1080 will be just applied for show. great if you are buying under 34 go for it, phone has lots of good features but some bad ones are no fingerprint unlock ,only 1sim card , 4gphone and lastly the battery backup, they are also fooling indian customers by not giving a chargerPhone camed to me in original state with no deffect and it wasn't refurbished also thankyou darshita electronics and camed fully secured in a secured packageConclusion should not buy in 2022 it's quite old now

I really was hesitant to get this phone mainly cause of the many negative reviews but the ones that did sound positive made me have hope that I might get a legit phone too. I was really hoping to not get scammed and proven I am not. I ordered this phone on the 17th and I received it today, the 20th. The packaging could have been better....it was just a cardboard box inside a plastic bag but the phone's main box was intact. I opened the box and I was so relived to see the phone. It was out of battery so I charged it for about 5 mins till the apple logo came up to the start up screen. I'm currently updating my new phone to the latest os and checking the authenticity (you can check using the IMEI code into https://checkcoverage.apple.com). The phone is in mint condition. It came intact, no dents in the phone nor box, no scratches. Face ID and True Tone works really well too. I must say...getting this phone at almost 50% off was a good deal. On the box, it says 52K but I got this for 34K. And with the frequent annual updates from Apple, I can say this will last me for another 3 years. Anyway, I appreciate this seller for not scamming me. So, yeah, if you want this phone and you are searching for the comment to verify your concerns i hope I have encouraged you to not be afraid and just get this phone if you are wondering if its too much of a risk. (Before giving the delivery guy the OTP, I opened the package checked the phone and verified its there...so yeah..do what you must cause money is money).Stay safe reader.

This iPhone XR is 2018 model manufactured in October 2020. Received at battery completely dried condition. The worst part is now Iphones are supplied without charger. Phone package is also not having any damper proof seal. For Rs 33999 is it advisable to buy a 2018 model one year old stock even without a charger, really everyone has to think twice before buying iPhone. I used 6splus already. There is not much difference in IOS 15. Feels solid in hand but front glass is plasticky it’s not a gorilla glass. Display is not Bessel less even above 1 lakh priced iphone13 is not having Bessel less hence no meaning of expecting this from their lower end phones. Its not supporting other fast chargers, but simply its charging. From 75% to 100% with a 33W PD charger it took 1 hour, even there is no indication whether its fast charging or normal charging, also no information how long will take to full charge.  Speakers are just OK loud enough. The best part is face unlock works well even at night. Instead of this for Rs34000/- can go for best Samsung models

","
I ordered this as a gift for my partner. The reason I chose this model is I have been using iPhone XR, 128gb, White for more than two years now and I am fully satisfied with the phone considering it’s price and features. My partner is not a specs lover as much as I’m. She care more about the colors and I thought she would love the Coral, 64 gb version (bought it for 34,999). Anyone who is in doubt whether to buy it or not, it’s still a good option in 2021 or even 2022 for those in a budget.

 The phone is super fast with the A12 Bionic chip , the box comes with type c to lightning cable which charges the phone super fast. Feels a little bit warmer while charging and that may be due to the fast charging adaptor. The camera is awesome. Even though with a single camera setup it wins over the iPhone X, Coming to the display, it has an IPS LCD display which looks way better than some trash android Amoled display. Face recognition and other AIs are awesome!

Wrong colour phone was sent to me. It’s heating up high while I’m on call, use internet, surf webs, etc. Dial pad not working while I called on Custome care number of apple support.. waste of money, pls don’t buy this. Adding to which Amazon is not taking any responsibility once it is delivered unlike other smart phone.. It’s dead deal, once your order is delivered no support from Amazon for exchange or return or Color change.. Don’t ever buy iPhone from Amazon.

This phone is amazing even in 2022

I bought this phone a week ago. I bought it now in January 2022. I use my phone basically for social media, light video editing, photography, photo editing, mail, gaming, and media consumption.It works smoothly in all the cases even though this phone was made in 2018.It still feels more premium than other android phones of its range and has a wonderful camera, even with a single main 12mp lens.It’s screen was widely discussed about and it is a controversial topic as the screen is not even full hd, but tbh, if you’re a general user with a normal screen, this screen will look much better and more premium. It only gets defeated by the oled screens out there.Software updates will probably go on till 2024 considering iPhone 6 is losing its support this year. This phone is still on a different level, no denying it.P.S. It’s got an iPhone battery, so ya, it might finish before you want it to, but that’s the case with iPhones.If you want to switch from android to iPhone and don’t want to spend too much, this phone is the best choice.

It’s good to have iPhone XR model which has 7MP front camera and 12MP back camera. Battery life is little good, pics are neat and videos too with 4K support up to 720p. Only disadvantage in iPhone XR is charger. Working with apps and internet is good. Can call a standard smartphone.

This is my first iphone. Overall happy with it. Brought iphone XR instead of iphone 12 because I just want to experience the feel of IOS. Other features like camera, display, 5G is not very important for me. Only concern for me was the battery back up, whether it can last upto one full day or not! But after using this for two weeks I find out it can last one full day very easily with 7 hours screen on time(I dont play game on my phone).

Review on iPhone XR

is good. But not happy with Amazon, since the buy back was not met by them. The policy says the buy back phone should be working and in good condition.  But just because the phone has a slight crack, which is not even noticeable, they denied taking it. However, when discussed with many of my friends everyone is of the same opinion that Amazon does this when buy back happens. They come out with some lame excuses. But whatever said and done, the product is superb.

Liked the overall build quality of the iPhone & the camera was exceptional.  Also the speed is incomparable. Feels good to hold this iPhone in the hand . Unlike pro max's big bulky frame ,this iPhone has rounded corners so fits in your pocket easily. Also budget friendly.  So we should definitely think of buying this iPhone before other iPhones & also before buying other premium mobile phones in the market.

My review after 6 months of usage.

As an android user for past few years, this was my first ios device.  So far so good. The Ui is really snappy and those who want things to be done quickly and smoothly they should always go for ios(provided they don’t like customisation of their device)Camera quality is by far the best than any android device I have used so far. The face recognition is lighting fast even at low light conditions as they use a special infrared sensor. The only down side is battery which fine for me but might not be the best for a heavy user.I won’t bring out the comparison between ios devices and android devices. It depends on you which one you want to use. Both have their own advantages.And if you ask me if you should buy this phone. That would be a 100% Yes.

The product is good.

But it’s good to go or maybe my luck that’s the headset is working fine.Only issues I faced with the ph is there is no adapter and the most important is the space after having only 200 images space shows full and demands to purchase the space.You are buying such an expensive phone and after using it for 20 days it’s says the space is full is no good deal. Mine is 64 GB but still for 200 pics only I mean seriously.

So this is my first iPhone since I moved from Android. The interface is different and mildly perplexing but you will get used to it eventually. The camera quality is great- no doubt about that. However my major praise is battery life. I haven’t used the phone for gaming, still I am able to get around 24+ hours of battery life.The major con I will let users shifting from Android know is the transfer of WhatsApp chats from your Android phone to the iPhone. Unfortunately none of your chats can be transferred AtoI. Let’s hope WhatsApp fixes this issue soon. Other that all in all great purchase. Go for it!

Reviewing after using it for last 3 days, bought from an offline store:1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option.2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers.3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good.4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging.5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well.6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9.7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch.8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9.9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9.10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus  9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger.Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.

Bought this a day backAt this price range I felt this phone is a crap.Here are the reasons why1) Terrible heating issue near to the camera with moderate usage - Might be from the processor2) Battery optimization  sucks - with moderate usage it dint lasted for 7 hours3)Only 15W Charger will be in the box3) At this price range competitors provide better finger print reader4) cheaper corilla glass 3 is used5) Snapdragon  860 and 865 has some heating issues  and other issues6)Back design makes this phone less premiumOverall at 40k price - This phone in not woth for the money 😑 ...if you're looking for mid flagship camera..then you can go for this phone.Considering  the heating issue this phone rate will drop further.. When it drops to 30k you can buy this phone

I was using OnePlus 5t for last 3 years. Thought of changing the phone and after made lot of research choose samsung s20 fe over OnePlus 9 and till date I don't have any regret for that.. it's simply an amazing phone.Pros:1. Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above.2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want.3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers..4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though.Cons:1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal.2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though.3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better.4. Fingerprint reader could have been better.Edit:OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI. Too good in my opinion.

Writing this review after 3 months of usage.Will divide this review into pros and cons.First, the Pros:1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience.2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously.. I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products.3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great.4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point.5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately.6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience.7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance.8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing.9.5G ready with 9 5g bands.Cons:1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range.2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times.3.Average front camera.Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.

 The ideal Samsung packing with vaccum sealed plastic was not there. Most importantly, the product seal was broken and cellophane take was applied on it. It was clearly a refurbished or repackaged product from this seller. PFA images for reference.I had paid 1500 so that this comes from a prime seller and fulfilled by amazon with an expectation that an INR 45K+ would be a brand new & untampered piece. However, that expectation is down the drain along with trust. This is completely unacceptable and fraudulent activity.Terrible response from customer service as well. When contacted by the customer service agent, she recommended opening the seal & check the piece if it is ok. When I asked the intention of doing it... they replied if it's ok to use then you can use it. When asked how can you make such a suggestion when you know it's wrong and the customer has been sent a faulty product.... the reply was my senior manager told me.This is totally unprofessional, shocking, wrong, and unacceptable. Why should I, the customer, open an expensive item whose seal is refurbished and be satisfied with it. I have paid a large sum of money for a brand new device. The so-called senior manager didn't come on the call when I requested. As you already have recorded, I want this investigated, or else I can provide the audio.After a back and forth for 1hr, the issue was resolved with a replacement of the product. However, at this point, I have completely lost faith & trust in the seller ""Prime Benefit"". Kindly note I would be requesting a refund if there is even a single bit wrong with the product or the packaging for the replacement.

I have been using this phone for a month. I am a medium heavy user, so I've written the review accordingly.1) DisplayDisplay is good for the price. It's bright enough under sunlight and dark enough for night usage. Resolution is good and the colors are punchy enough. Overall a good display. My only problem is with the usage of Gorilla Glass 3 on the display. It does come with a screen guard pre-installed.2) Battery lifeAt 120Hz refresh rate and with my medium heavy usage (2-3 hours of social media, 1-2 hours of YouTube etc) it lasted till evening and I had to charge my phone before dinner. At 60Hz and same usage it lasts till bedtime. So I do get 6-7 hours of screen on time which is good enough. You also have features like sleep and Deep sleep where the apps you don't use much goes to sleep and apps which you don't use for days goes to deep sleep, for more info please google on this.The display is locked on 120Hz refresh rate and it's not adaptive, I wish it was adaptive, that way battery could last longer at 120Hz refresh rate too.3) CameraCamera is really good and you can use GCam without rooting. I have attached a few pictures I took in the past few days. The observation I had is that it tries to capture a lot of details in default camera app. This is good in daylight but in night light it adds static noise, it's not that visible unless you zoom in so it's ok, no big deal. The colors are a subjective thing so no comments on that.4) SoftwareYou can find a lot of videos on OneUI hidden features, how to make fingerprint sensor faster, etc on YouTube easily. Overall OneUI is good. There are Bixby routines which were new for me but now I use it daily. Also they promise 3 years of Android version updates and 4 years of Android security updates so you're good for 3-4 years.5) ProcessorI bought the 5G version with SnapDragon processor. I played games alot and it didn't heat up as much so thumbs up for that. Gaming mode is good as well in software front. It also consumes less battery so that's good too. There are also more number of 5G bands supported than other phones in the competition at this price, so ya.Overall it's a phone which does everything but not best in everything which is exactly what I wanted. I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others.My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.

I wanted a phone number which does everything and I didn't want it to be good in just one department and lack in others.My only problem is with the positioning of the fingerprint reader, it's really low. And also the silver ring around the front camera but I think I'll get used to it soon. Hope this review helps you in decision. Peace.

For the price of 48k, I see this device as the perfect balance between performance, value and future proof. I bought this instead of OnePlus 9 and 9R and do not regret this decision at all.

Manufacture defect

Everything was good but I found a manufacture defect it it. A click sound was coming from the back side whenever a put the phone on any surface. While slowly shaking the phone the sound frequency increased.I talked to customer support for replacement and they did it successfully.Received the new phone but truly disappointed.Found same issue like the 1st one.Placed a return request for it.🙏

Wi-Fi becomes horribly slow when the phone is warm due to charging or heavy usage
","
The phone itself is great. Camera is pretty nice. Especially for me as I am trying to upgrade from S10 Lite. Primarily wanted to buy this for wireless charging and water resistance. However, one massive issue in the unit that I got today… Wi-Fi is extremely glitchy. My S10 Lite remains stable on 866mbps in network details. S20 FE fluctuates anywhere form ~300-500mbps. If this was not bad enough, the phone’s Wi-Fi speed drops hugely when it gets slightly warm. My 300mbps connection barely registers 15-20mbps on this phone. Should mention here that there are lots of isolated cases of S20 series phones having similar issues online. From Samsung’s own support forum to XDA to reddit and other Android communities.If you buy this phone, my recommendation would be to keep an eye on the wi-fi performance. WiFiMan is a great app would show the connection speed with router (internet speed is irrelevant here if you are not on a gigabit connection). On my device it fluctuates heavily with upload speed falling down to 6mbps regularly and staying there for long periods. This could very well be Samsung throttling Wi-Fi modem to save battery I imagine. But this could end up hurting longer downloads or creating slowdowns while doing simple tasks.I ended up applying for a refund. I love this phone but I cannot rely on Samsung on fixing the unreliable wifi in a future software update. They need to acknowledge the problem in Sep 21 batch.

Great Phone, Offers best in the range.
","
Just loved it. It offers unbelievably everything what you could wish for. Writing this review after around 20 days of use.Well the major pros:1. Look wise the phone is awesome.2. Ultra Smooth UI, loved the One UI 3.1 (first time using Samsung ).  A combination of 120 Hz, Super AMOLED and Snapdragon 865 makes it awesome3. Camera is exceptional. OIS works great which is missing in OP. I have attached images for references:  a. Moon Image is taken at 30X Zoom just with hands without tripod, see how stabilised that is.  b. Night mode is ultimate, believe me it can capture what eyes can't see  c. Day light, colour reproduction is great. Loved the Ultra Wide and Zoom cameras, both do the job with perfection.  d. Videos are very smooth, and it supports 4K upto 60fps. Slow motion and Ultra slow motion both work great.4. 5G support is there with 9 bands, although couldn't test anything in India.5. Fingerprint, Face recognition works pretty fast.6. Used Samsung Pay for the first time, it is awesome and something missing in all others. Just added my card it that, and tapped phone to pay directly. It authenticates using Fingerprint.7. It supports 15W Fast Wireless charging, which works flawless.8. Battery life is great, When I am not using it much, easily gives 2 days (46 hours) at 60Hz display. There are multiple ways to save battery. Initially battery consumption was more. It takes i think 6-7 days to learn the usage pattern by Android 11. After that it puts the un-used apps to sleep and deep sleep. Battery life increases to almost double after this9. Feature I loved the most - the phone is IP68, I have tested it multiple times, putting under Tap water and rain. Just don't charge when port is wet. Phone will warn itself with a notification.10. Supports upto 1 TB micro SD through hybrid SIM slot, so 2nd SIM has to be compromised, so I am not using it.Cons:1. Charging is bit slow, not like dash charge.2. Wireless charging is also not that fast.3. Screen brightness is a bit low, compared to higher end phones, but perfect when compared to lower ends.I recommend this over OP, until you are only into Gaming. It is not jack of all, its actually a king, with just a compromise from Snapdragon 888 to 865.

Samsung at its best

The best among the budget flagship smartphones in the market. I am extremely satisfied with this.If you can compromise without a 3.5mm headphone jack and a physical proximity sensor (although there is a virtual proximity sensor to compensate but it doesn't work like the physical one), then this will be a better choice than One Plus 9.

Thank you so much samsung for sending a defective phone. You made the first impression to last for very long. What happened to Good old fashion of testing the product before packaging. You have started making phones costlier and costlier for Indian market (even if it is made in India).

Highly disappointing for me as I bought Samsung S20 FE 5G phone on 6June 2021 and Camera was not working Manufacturing defect, I have visited the Samsung service center 4 time but unfortunately they did not fix the issue. When I mailed the case to samsung support they again asked to visit service center and assured me that this time they will fix the issue but post visiting the service center again the camera issue persist.Now I again raised the mail to samsung executive assign for my case they asked me to visit Samsung service center again, to fix the issue and even no one is replying to my mails now.This is how Samsung is irritating the customer with 0% customer satifaction with no resolution on Issues.Please don't buy Samsung Mobile and go for other brands like oneplusWorst  Products  from Samsung

Edit: May 22, after a month of use : Amazon providing 6K off now, no wonder whyCons:1. Finger scanner is works only 6/10 times. May 22: Little better after the recent software upgrade2. Felt heat in the back even with very less usage. Understand that the phone have SD 865 and a external modem which means heat will be continued issue for this phone.3. Face reorganization will not work in low light (iPhone 11 unlocks very smooth in the same lighting condition)4. It felt like a very old model phone5. Volume and power button are in the same side (very hard to use)6. Low light photos are horrible7. Take ~5 hours for full charge. Battery discharge very fast if you have any peripheral connected to it.8. Videos will not play in full screen because of screen bezel in the top.Pros:1. Good for basic photo2. Phone is not large but heavy with 4500 mah battery3. Sound and voice call quality is good4. 120 Hz refresh rate is buttery smoothWith my one month observation, I will not recommend S20 FE 5G, recommends iPhone 11 128GB based on my usage of both phones.

You need to know this before you make your buying decisions

This phone comes with a IP68 rating. I have been using this phone for last 3 months. Presently it is having some charging problem.It is showing that moisture or foreign material is there in charging port. Same need to be dried or removed prior to using that port for  charging. In the mean time wireless charger can be used to charge the phone.After seeing this,  I took my mobile to Samsung care. There they said that the charging port is completely damaged because of moisture ingress. Same need to be replaced. And this will cost around Rs 1850.!!!! No free service within warranty period😔 !!!!So I request all the potential buyers to answer this.Q-1) If having a IP 68 rating mobile cannot resist moisture attack, then what's the point.Q-2) Within warranty period and for a IP68 rating phone, whether a customer need to pay for any damage because of moisture ingress.

After researching for months to replace my old workhorse MotoZ2force, I zeroed in samsung s20fe(exonys). But was vary of the processor.So when they launched the SD one I was Intrigued.However a price difference of 10k was something I didn't want to afford.So one day I got a 4000 rs coupon on Amazon so I bought it instantly.After cashback etc I got it for 41773, which is a steal. I would repeat, unless S21Fe is launched this phone is a steal anywhere under 45k.I lost my last phone due to water damage so IP68 protection was must which only A72 was offering.It also have many 5G bands but that should not be the reason to buy a phone at this time.The camera quality is good, see some samples.The image stabilization is great(see the moonshot.The sensor is not that great as my older motoz2force, but the software makes up for it.Also the 3x zoom lens comes handy in many situations.Display is great 120HZ is great but even 60hz(which automatically switches to 60hz in battery saver mode) is good and a normal user won't pick a difference.Fingerprints reader is great. In last 15 days I have not encountered any issues at all.I mainly use the face unlock which works most of the time.Finally, we Indians should start recognizing the value of software also and only the hardware specs. The UI is simple on one hand and highly customizable on the other.If you explore a bit then you can automate many tasks and increase the battery life also.Many people complain about only 15 watt charger in box. Well fast charging is good in many cases, but it reduces your battery life. And the 65 watt charging advertisement by chinese ones may see like wow but in a few months you will see how this fast charging reduces your battery backup and life. Call me old fashioned buy I am more than Ok with slow charging.

No Gimmicks + DEX + Excellent Camera
","
In this era of 2MP macro-mono-depth stupidity in midrangers and budget-flagships, this device stands out with its pure functional and flagship-like camera setup. DEX is another amazing functionality, i wonder why people are not mentioning it in reviews. Samsung has promised 4 years of security updates and 3 android major updates. There are 9 5G bands, so i assume this phone is truly 5G-ready in India. These points were enough for me to shift to this phone. I read some reviews complaining heating issues and ordinary design of this phone. Though I am not a heavy gamer, I use my phone for a long consecutive times. It only got warm during initial setup. But there was NO heating issue otherwise. About design, it is a personal choice. I am not a fan of glass backs (am i the only one on this planet?) Phone still looks very premium in my opinion.I switched from OP5 after almost 4 years. OP5 was one-of-its-kind, and was ahead of its time. Sadly oneplus is no more the enthusiast brand that it was some years ago. Single band 5g, shady updates (i heard op7, op7t got slower with the updates), and i just hate that 2/5 MP mono camera  that op is standardizing these days. Concluding, Samsun S20 FE 5G is a perfect choice for someone who is looking for non flashy, simple design yet truly functional and non-gimmicky experience in a device that can be used for around 3-3.5 years.

MVP in below ₹50k price bracket
","
I purchased this phone after extensive research (~5 months) of YouTube reviews as well as real ownership experience from family and friends of many phones in the 25k to 40k INR price bracket.I was able to get this one at 38k after exchange of my existing phone.Have to say that this is the best one in this price range and even under 50k.All flagship features that a person would want are available at this price.And I'm speaking from experience of having used iPhone XS and OnePlus 7T Pro of my own parents.Haven't faced any heating (or even warming) issue except during initial setup.For people who still aren't convinced, I will update my review after using for 2 weeks and then again after a month if needed.Edit (25-06-2021): After 2 weeks of extensive usage, I can still confirm that I have faced zero heating issues and very rare ""warming"" from this phone.One suggestion which I would make to existing and potential owners of this phone is to go to Settings->Connections->Mobile networks and change it to LTE/3G/2G from the existing 5G option.I'm still getting maximum 4G and 4G+ speeds without the phone having to search for non-existant 5G networks in India.For Screen-on-time, I'm consistently getting ~6.5 hours(Display at 120Hz), easily lasting a full day and having to recharge only the next day.P.S: If you are a hardcore gamer and are willing to shell out 40k+ on a phone then ROG phones would be better for you.In all other aspects, this phone takes the cake.P.P.S : If you don't have a pair of Bluetooth earphones already and don't plan on getting one either, just buy the official Samsung Type C to headphone jack adapter. Works brilliantly well! Just google Samsung EE-UC10JUWEGIN

I've used this phone for a month and a half now.Here's my review for the same -1. Camera is really good 9/102. Audio quality is good, though the volume is a little on the lower side 6/103. Battery life is decent, I can mostly get through the day without having to charge it 7/104. Charging is too slow, like the older generation phones without any fast charging. Takes 2hrs for my phone to charge fully. Update - The 25w charger fills it up pretty fast. Takes around an hour. 4/105. Display is good and smooth 9/106. OneUI. This is my first samsung phone and I loved the software's look and feel, how the notifications and app drawer have amazing blur effects in the background. There are still a few bugs here and there though 8/107. Fingerprint reader is slow but accurate 5/108. Face recognition fails most of the time, to a point that I've stopped using it now 1/109. Call quality and audio is amazing on this phone. It is very loud and crispy clear 10/1010. The phone gets heat up a lot, on the upper side of the body and screen, while charging as well as gaming. I'm actually scared to buy the 25w charger thinking that it might make the phone heat up even more 7/10 Update - I got the 25w charger and it didn't heat up at all.

Actually this is not a review,  it's direct comparison between s20 fe and oneplus 9 series. and the winner is off course s20 fe. I am oneplus user from oneplus 3t, op5, op5t, op6 and the last oneplus I had oneplus 7t. after that I never found any satisfactory phone from oneplus. so I decided to go with Samsung. and the s20 fe is actually satisfactory and budget friendly. the one ui is very good as oxygen os. face unlock and fingerprint unlock is a little bit slower than oneplus but definitely accurate. and most important things the camera is awesome. I really didn't expect that it's camera is miracle. it's 12 mp is just a number but believe me the 108 mp of mi or 48 mp of oneplus is nothing infront of this. here is some picture of extreme night condition and night mode, the hdr and off course the moon. the night mode is just miracle. the only bad thing is the slow charging speed. I have 25 watt charger. but the charging speed is not like my last phone oneplus 7t. overall A very good phone in this range. thank you Samsung 😊

I have used for 3 days. I love its blazing fast performance. Display is crispy & vivid color it is the main attraction. Camera is mindblowing. Nightmode feature surprised me.

This phone has AR zone app. You can play with augmented reality models.

Worth every penny!

Pros:1. I'm a photographer so this matters to me. This phone has an amazing camera. I'm so glad I chose this phone over the OnePlus 9R due to the telephoto lens. The 3x zoom is just so good even 10x zoom gives you some really crisp images. Please forget about the number of megapixels and all, never trust ""64MP"" or ""48MP"" to be a good camera due to just these numbers. Average user or photographer, you will definitely enjoy this camera. Even the night mode on both front and back cameras is just really really good. Most of the time it can capture things in a dark room that I'm unable to focus on with my own eyes!!2. 120Hz AMOLED Screen by Samsung. It's as gorgeous as I expected. And the notch is pretty small too, not distracting at all, tbh.3. One UI. I used to think One UI was ok, nothing great but after seeing One UI 3.1 (which it comes with) my viewpoint changed. It's such a beautiful, smooth and simple UI. And the upcoming One UI 4.0 update will allow you more customisation so you'll just love it.4. Updates. You'll get 3 years of Android updates and that's great for a 40,000 phone.5. Build quality. It may look simple but once you hold it, it just feels premium. The cold aluminium, and the compact backside, it just feels great every time I remove the case.6. The performance is also really good. You don't really need a Snapdragon 888 tbh cuz 865 will give you everything you want. Gaming, video editing, it will do it fast and well. And not much heating, just slightly warm while playing games, almost unnoticable.7. IP68 rating. You can literally wash this thing like you wash your hands and nothing bad will happen.8. This may sound dumb but I appreciate the slower 15W charger because (a) it's not THAT slow, and (b) it will prolong the battery life in the long run if you don't use a super fast charger. The capacity will remain mostly intact throughout the 3-4 years that you use due to any slow chargers.9. The stereo speakers are surprisingly crisp and clear. Even music can be easily enjoyed on it, there's good bass and all. And if you're in a quiet room, even better.Cons:1. The battery life is honestly not that great. It's not horrible but I expected better. Even with battery saver I'm not getting much. But it's not a huge deal because the battery definitely is still reliable and good, it's just not great.2. Haptics are very boring and even budget phones give better vibration while typing and all. But this is kind of a nitpick since it doesn't make a huge difference tbh.3. Lack of headphone jack. Using a dongle just gives me less quality and it's a bit annoying to carry around. And wireless buds of good quality are just twice as more expensive as good quality wired headphones/earphones.Overall, I'm just really happy with this phone and I'm very glad I got it. And if you're considering S21FE, just skip it. There's honestly no real difference and the price is 14,000 higher.Hope I helped 🙏

 I'm glad I took a full length unboxing video. One should always do this no matter what!Sharing a clip from the entire 7-8 min video.Right after unboxing it, I noticed scuff marks and scratches on the pre-applied screen protector which I intended to keep. Apart from that, it had a lot of dust particles on the front and back. This seems to be like a repackaged device, or it could genuinely be a packaging issue. Due to the scratches, there is rainbow effect in the affected portion of the screen. The rest of the device functions normally. I just hope I get a better piece on replacement that is flawless. Samsung really needs to work on the Q&A of their products. Now I will be waiting for the replacement to arrive, wasted weekend! This was supposed to be a gift for a loved one.Pros:Great Screen, love it at 120Hz.The dual stereo dolby atmos sound is kickass!Amazing camera, probably the best for 35-40k range. Nothing comes even close, including the shoddy marketing that chinese manufactures do by advertising ""108MP"" cameras and manufacturers like One Plus providing gimmicky lenses that do nothing at all if you know a bit of photography.Battery seems to be good. In the 10-15 minutes I tested to see how visible the scuffs are in videos etc, the drop was just about a percentOneUI 3 has come a long way! Really fantastic. Hoping 4 will be even better, and I am from the Apple eco-system since the past 7-8 years.The buttons are tactile and functional.Cons:The UI, while being amazing, can get overwhelming for people switching from OP or from stock android devices, but the extra settings are just a cherry on top once you spend time and know what each of them do and how much you can customize this phone to be uniquely yours.The included 15W charger is a major downer... especially for a phone with an MRP of INR 74,000/- even though it was down to 37k in sale. Not acceptable, early adopters from last year would have been really mad at this cheap move by Samsung.I really wish Samsung introduces an adaptive mode for the screen. I'm sure at 120Hz this will eat into the battery and 60Hz is too slow. Can't go back to 60 once you experience 120.I might have missed out on few pointers but will update the review once the replacement arrives. For now it's at 2 stars.

Bought on 25th Apr. Have been using samsung since ages and was looking for a decent phone with good camera, screen and battery life. This phone covers all.While initiating and data transfer, did get a little hot but nothing post that. Most of the time is spent on calling including Whatsapp (3-4 hours) and watching serials (5-6) hours and general net surfing (2-3 hours). Once charged in the morning, till night still 30% battery is left. No heating issues at all.The 120Hz refresh rate makes the viewing experience really smooth especially as compared to 60hz in the previous phone.The sound quality is good, speakers produce enough loud sound and movies and videos can be watched easily.Overall, a very good experience so far.

Worst WIFI Performance. Common Issue
","
I brought Samsung Galaxy S20 FE on Big Billion Day sale. It seems S20 FE seems to have worst wifi performance. After few minutes wifi speed drops to less then 10mbps. Even Coping files from Local NAS Server then speed is less then 10mbps. I have also Redmi K20 Pro. It never drops the speed below 250 mbps with NAS server. This issues seems to common across galaxy s20 series phones. Even more common for S20 FE made in India. Do a simple google search you will see lot of people complaining in reddit and XDA forum. I would advice against purchasing Samsung Galaxy S20 FE.

Best flagship experience at this price point

 Best thing about this phone is that it gives you a great flagship experience in such a price point... As it runs in one UI interface which makes the phone completely buttery experience.... No doubt it has one of the best camera in this category and over-all almost everything is good about the phone except the cons (personally for me) is that the charging could've been little fast,  another thing is the finger print reader is really slow which can be annoying sometimes and lastly the front camera is not great at all... But after you install gcam in your phone you can have little better results in front camera.... Overall it's a really good phone in this category... So if your priority is more into software experience and camera than definitely go for it!

Great phone with the flagship features that actually matter to the everyday user!

Can be a direct competition to iPhone 12 but at a much cheaper price as iPhone 12 128 GB costs ₹84,900 meanwhile Samsung S20 FE 5G costs ₹47,900. I binged watched YouTube videos about S20 FE 5G and comparisons with other phones such as the OnePlus 9 and iPhone 12. Also, this phone is MKBHD’s phone of the year for 2020.Software:- One UI is amazing and Samsung has promised 3 years of updates for this phone and have been regularly delivering on that promise by providing regular security updates since the last 6 months, according to my research through its reviews on YouTube. Regular updates haven’t been offered on OnePlus 9 as they tend to be half-baked and buggy updates since the last 2 years. Plus, additional Samsung features like Samsung Pay, Secure Photos, Samsung Dex, etc. are also very useful.- Samsung and Windows partnership has made it easy to use phone with your windows laptop. Works fine and is helpful. I guess it’s the closest it can get to iPhone Airdrop and sync feature with MacBook.- 60Hz and 120Hz works greats and keeps the phone smooth. iPhone 12 only has 60Hz but it runs as smooth due to its powerful Apple chip.Hardware:- Glass + plastic back which feels amazing to touch and doesn’t feel cheap to look or feel.- Great cameras which correct colour balance, and sharpness- much better than OnePlus 9. Videos are also sharp.- Mic and Front Facing stereo features are loud and clear. No call drops or cell tower problems on using Airtel and Vodafone. Dual sim works fine.- Includes a charger unlike iPhone 12.- IP68 water resistant and dust resistant rating which is missing on OnePlus 9.- Wireless charging and reverse charging works great to charge wireless earphones and wireless charging mobiles. Meanwhile wireless charging is missing on OnePlus 9.- Phone gets slightly hot when intense gaming is done on it. But it’s not unbearably hot and doesn’t throttle.- GeekyRanjit confirmed from Samsung that it has 9 bands of 5G as compared to Oppo or OnePlus phones in this range which only offer 2 or 3 bands of 5G hence this is more future ready for any 5G band that comes to India in the future.Battery Life:- With the in box charger, phone takes about 2 hours to charge from 0-100% and lasts all day depending on normal usage of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and some light gaming.Price:- While a 128 iPhone 12 costs ₹84,900, the same 128 GB Samsung S20 FE 5G variant costs lesser at ₹47,700 and also has additional micro-SD card slot which can expand the storage upto 1 TB. There is no such option on the iPhone.- Hybrid sim slot can be used with 1 sim + 1 SD card or with 2 sims instead.Final Verdict:It’s the best phone to get in this range. Has a balance of features - much more than a typical midrange phone and also gets some features from its flagship series S20. It also has a bigger battery than its elder brother - S20. It has all the features to make a good all rounder phone and should be able to last 3-4 years with regular updates and 9 5G bands making it more versatile to be compatible with all Indian 5G telecom providers whenever they launch 5G service in India.

Beware if you are replacing for faulty device
","
I had been a happy customer of amazon all these while. I had ordered this device and I received a sealed package which had a faulty charger, I requested for a replacement and received a device which was a sealed box,  I am sure that the packaging is not as per company standards on the replacement device. After opening the box I noticed that:1. The charger and the cable inside the box was not in the proper position inside the box.2. the protective layer along the edges of the phone was missing,3. the loudspeaker Audio output was not balanced, Audio on the earpiece side was low.4. charger was emitting high frequency noise. I did not expect this from a seller like Appario retail pvt ltd, to fool the customer by providing a refurbished/repacking the phone. I wish the management is aware of all these malpractices.

The Best Budget Flagship experience
","
First up. I was upgrading from my still in excellent shape Oneplus 6t. In fact it was such a fantastic experience that i wanted to stay in the oneplus family. However, since the last 4 years that i have owned it the prices of oneplus have skyrocketed and from being a flagship killer, Oneplus now consists only of flagships. My budget was about 35-40k.my first choice was the Oneplus 9RT. Top specs, superfast, decent camera and good looking in that new black shade. But no wireless charging. I know wireless charging atleast at the current slow speeds is more gimmick but then its just like people wanting cars with a sun roof even if it serves no real purpose.Since it had to be android, my next choice was samsung. I had used a note 4 in the past and was extremely happy with it, so started looking up their portfolio. S21 FE was my immediate choice, but then the Exynos processor was a bummer and so was the price.Thats when i saw the S20 FE. Snapdragon chipset, very good camera and wireless and reverse charging. Yes it did not have the latest gorilla glass, chipset was a year old but remember, upgrading from a Oneplus 6t, it was still an upgrade. The icing on the cake was 3 major android updates and 4 years of security  updates meant i could use this for a good 4 years if i have to, just like my oneplus.quick delivery, phone is everything that it promises and the only downgrade over the oneplus is the 15W charger ad the charging time which is an hour which can be made a little better with a 25W charger.Highly recommended for people with under 40k budget.

Regret buying

Regret buying it within 24 hours. I rushed to buy. Wrong decision. I've been using redmi note 5 pro for 4 years and redmi note 3 for some years before that. I thought I wanted to get away from these redmi displays to Amoled but it's a mistake. The display is not good at all. I can't watch YouTube or any other video without being annoyed by either the poor quality display or the video flickering. Yes, videos are not played good on this device.Charging takes several hours to be full even with fast charger. I have a Lenovo x1 yoga charger and I'm using that to charger this phone. Still slow charging.No front flashCamera isn't that greatI barely installed any apps and the ram is about 3.5 free out of 8Worst ram management.

Calling them gets me the same message that nothing is in their hands now and that I have to wait.Pros :1. Worked flawlessly for 15 days.Cons :1. Pretty much everything else.2.

A good phone at this price point but not that great.

A good phone at this price point. The only drawbacks are charging (15w is way too slow, also fast charging is only displayed when u plug in the phone and later it charges the battery at a normal speed) and 3.5mm audio jack. Observed heating while playing cod but it's not that bad. Camera quality is good and gives you OK shots at night. Gives you 6-8 hrs screen time depending on the apps u r using & battery is k k .other than above exceptions everything looks good.

Display Issues are serious
","
Beautiful product with some flaws in execution.I have browsed several reddit forums and samsung members community app only to find that issues around display are recurring in this device.1. Ghost touches - this I didn't face. Some people had reported that screen takes touch inputs on its own.2. Brightness banding - this is what happens when you are looking at a phone in a dark room (like I did before sleeping, scrolling through social media). If a background is grey, it is very uneven, with some portions of screen dimly lit and others brightly lit. It becomes very irritating since we use dark mode to conserve battery. Whatsapp looked brighter in the upper half, so did chrome when all tabs were closed and any grey/greyish tone for that matter didn't look perfect. What's worse is that samsung in India says this is a characteristic of the display and therefore, it cannot be repaired/replaced. I saw enough red flags and just returned it within 7 day window to get full refund. You can refer to the first pic, this is how my display was. Search on google - ""Samsung S20 FE banding"" to see more such cases.3. Green tint - again related to grey background in a dark room with low brightness, where grey can look green. I have uploaded this, refer to 2nd image. Not my unit but someone received it with that issue.Search on google - ""Samsung S20 FE Green Tint"" to see more such cases.While the device offers a lot at such a compelling price, it's futile if faulty units in large quantities have been manufactured. Sours the user experience - samsung giving a snapdragon phone in India was the only reason I bought it, and now had to return an otherwise perfect device marred with display issues.

I'm a big oneplus fan and I was using the oneplus 6t for about 2 and a half years....I was very skeptical about choosing this phone over the oneplus9r...but I'm happy with this phone...the display is gorgeous just would have liked some more visibility outdoor...120hz is buttery smooth....camera and videos are turning out to be flagship level! Fingerprint scanner works better in oneplus devices...battery life is mediocre but manageable in work from home scenario...charging is pathetically slow..but really happy that this phone is future proof with a lot of 5g bands and happy that my phone back is not glass and that it won't break...also extremely happy with the ip68 rating.Stereo speakers are good in quality...selfie cam could have been a tad better especially indoors!Transition from oxygen ui to one ui was difficult but super worthy as I can see that one ui is feature richMy verdict go for it! Especially with oneplus not anymore the same oneplus and it's famous oxygen os turning into color os it's time to ditch it

Probably the best phone in this segment
","
Using this phone for more than a couple of weeks now. I was using Samsung Note series earlier, so naturally my expectations were very high and I must say that this phone has not disappointed me at all. I had gone through detailed reviews before purchase and the phone delivered what expected. After using it for sometime, below are my observations:1) The glastic build looks premium and good to hold in hand. But could be better with metal body / glass back.2) Weight of the phone is a bit on the higher side compare to the last note series phone I was using. It may be due to the bigger battery and bigger screen size. But really does not make much differences.3) In terms of capacity, the battery might not be the best one. But it is quite optimized with the processor and gives almost similar backup with higher battery capacity phones with lower processors. For me the battery lasts for around 1.5 days with moderate usage. Wireless charging and reverse wireless charging feature makes it different from others in the segment.4) Does not have FM radio and even I did not have it in my last note series phone as well. Probably the flagships do not have it. No difference for me, but of course it is a nice to have feature.5) No 3.5 mm jack. May be a concern but I think it is aligned with the vision of wireless accessories for flagships. If you need it, one can buy USB C-Type to 3.5 mm converter.6) For the flagship processor, performance is really smooth and fast. No heating at all.7) Supports 25 Watt fast charging but box contains 15 watt charger. This is a bit disappointing. With 15 Watt charger it takes around a couple of hours to get fully charged from ZERO.8) IP68 protection is really a flagship feature and it is the only phone in this segment to offer it.9) Hybrid 2nd SIM slot with up to 1TB memory card support is useful. But I would prefer a dedicated memory card slot.10) 5G support is not relevant for India as of now but can not do much with it since it is a standard offering nowadays with flagship processors in all the phones in this segment.11) India as Country of Origin probably get an extra thumbs up.12) Nothing to mention about camera. It is indeed one of the best without any gimmick of megapixels or extra lenses. It just optimum with best output. 8MP Telephoto lens makes it different.13) With additional 6K instant discount makes it absolutely value for money and even better than all competitor phones around it.What else you need? It is absolutely Value for Money and probably the best smartphone in this segment as of now.

Amazing phone!
","
I was confused between the oneplus 9r and this phone. Finally went with this one. I have been a oneplus user since one plus one till oneplus 5 then I shifted to honor view 20 and then to this. This is my first Samsung phone and I am truly loving it. I would recommend anybody going through the confusion of choosing between the oneplus 9r or this should opt for the Samsung. These are the reasons why I chose this.The cameras are great. Amazing pictures! The battery life is amazing and the screen is beautiful too. The one ui is amazing. Clean fast and very responsive like the oxygen os. Only a 15 watt charger is supplied with this but I believe slower charging phones are better in the longer run for the battery life. You can always buy a Samsung 25 watt charger if you wish to speed up the process. Fingerprint scanner is a tad bit slower but it's ok as long it is doing its job. There is only a few mili second difference between the oneplus and this. The phone is 5g ready and future proof with many bands. Samsung also promises 4 years of os and security updates. When you buy a phone at a premium price such as this you would want to keep it for good 2-3 years. Also samsung resale price is always going to be better than oneplus. When the time comes to upgrade the value of a Samsung won't go down as much as other Chinese phones. I got this phone for 34k with the discount coupon and the exchange so all in all a steal of a price. The phone is still learning what apps I use and what I don't and it puts it to deep sleep. This helps with the battery life. I am getting anywhere between 11-12 hours of sot with normal use. It only turned hot on the first day when i was setting up the phone but only for a few minutes. I haven't felt any heating issues what so ever. I would highly recommend this phone over the oneplus any given day. I have been a oneplus fan boy but not anymore. I will choose a Samsung over oneplus any given day.

Good overall package

I am writing this review after using the phone for a month. Good delivery by Amazon, arrived earlier than expected. As a whole the phone is good. The camera quality has been exceptional. The photos are beautiful. I was a bit skeptical between choosing Samsung and Oneplus. I chose Samsung because it's a good wholesome package.It has a great camera setup. Since the dragon is 865, it's a beast and does whatever the task you throw at it. The phone runs buttery smooth. It never disappointed me. The battery life is bad initially, but it got better and better. It's fine now. On normal to medium usage I get an entire day. On heavy usage it's out of juice by evening. The UI is a bit heavy since it offers tons of customizations. I'm ok with any UI actually so it's not a big deal for me. I'm acquainted with the UI now. I'll attach some photos.

It's sad to waste time on such things.I will update my review after I'll get a replacement or a refund as best feasible. I purchased S20 FE after watching lots of YouTube videos.

Blockbuster Phone
","
This is easily one of the best phone Samsung has ever made. The overall specs and performance matches that of flagships with a price that is substantially less. It's an easy recommendation and the best smartphone available in its sub Rs 50,000 segment.Samsung's build quality, design and display beats other brands and it also comes with a great camera setup. Smooth 120Hz AMOLED display with a powerful Snapdragon chip gives crazy fast performance on Android 11. It has LPDDR4X RAM and fast UFS 3.1 storage and there are no lags at all even when playing demanding games.Lastly, you get wireless charging with reverse charging support. I have not had any issues with battery so far and it lasts a full day for me. Some might complain that the bundled charger does not give you fast charging. At least you get a charger, and fast charging almost always results in battery degradation over time.To summarize, if you want a feature packed phone with flagship performance at a great price, go for it. I personally avoid buying Chinese brands and have been a Samsung user for many years now. My previous phone was Samsung A50 which lasted for more than 3 years. You don't get the software support, build quality and peace of mind with similar phones by Chinese brands.

Display is smooth and you can experience flagship feeling.3. 5g with 9 bands, better than one plus 9 series here.4. Good one UI with great features and actually samsung has improved a lot, and i can say its now par with oxygen OS.5. 3 years andoid and 4 years of security updates, better than one plus updates.6. Rear camera set up is good, good night mode and telephoto lens is also usable.7. Wireless and reverse wireless charging, with IP68 certification, that good.Now cons:-1. 15 watt charger when its support 25 watt, it take 2 hrs. To get fully charged, so behind there with one plus 9 series.2. Selfie camera is very average, it gives very smooth tone to photos not much sharpness.3. Its SD 865 which is very capable processor but i still felt this phone is not meant for hard core gamer, frames drops when i played BGMI for 1 hr. Or more.4. There is no head phone jack, if they have given, i can then easily say its the best value for money phone right now from samsung.Overall its decent phone and you should go for it, if you get it around 40k and yes it feels premium and you get little flagship experience.Better to spend 40k then spending 80K on s21 and other.

Got a defective peice with battery issues. Spend a lot kf time with customer care and they took a placement request. Got the replacement and it was defective again. Finally just asked for refund. Wasted more than 7-8 hours copying all the data from one phone to another.Seems like they are trying to get rid of defective lots by giving some discount in festive season.

Overall review
","
One of the best alternative to One Plus and iphone 11. Camera is good. The phone looks Premium . Gaming is smooth. The only drawback is 4500 mah battery and the 15watt charger in the box. However, it supports  upto 25 watt.

Disappointed!!
","
I'm writing this review after using this mobile for more than two weeks. I was little disappointed with this product. Mainly because of below reasons.Mobile Battery is draining fastly and  also releasing extensive heat, if we use it for more than one hour.  it's taking more than 90 mins to get full charge with 15w. Audio quality is also not good. Due to ultra sonic Finger print sensor, it is emitting extra light, which is irritating to eyes at night times.I couldn't think of pros in this mobile as I am highly disappointed with this piece.

Feedback after 2 months of usage
","
Migrated from a One Plus 6 to Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5GShort and honest feedback after 2 months of usage:Camera is excellent! Vivid colors, sharper images. I'm no professional, but it serves my purpose nicely.Battery is 4500 mAh, of course more than One Plus 6 (4000 mAh). Though OP used to charge faster than Samsung. Samsung only fast charges for the first 50% which is weird.Fingerprint sensor is really slow and takes several attempts more often than not. Really bad considering the experience that I've had with One Plus.Phone feels premium in hand, sleek and light.Snapdragon variant. Samsung moved from Exynos to Snapdragon about 9-10 months ago, thank goodness for that!UI is decent. User friendly and a lot of customisation options available.Really harrowing experience with Amazon. Exchange did not work the first time since IMEI no. of my One Plus was not recognised. I had already done a factory reset and had no choice but to place another order with the second IMEI no. I lost a week's worth of backups while I had to wait for my second order to arrive.Will update later if I'm not too lazy.

The best electronic device I've ever purchased
","
Bought this phone in December for rs. 34000/-. At that price i really can't believe the features I've got. The main camera is brilliant.. the selfie cam on permanent night mode is good, phone is buttery smooth, multitasking using good lock ie one hand operation + edge panel is brilliant, one UI 4 on Android 12 is great and Bixby routines are fantastic and i can't live without them now, battery life may be an issue for people who don't use Bixby routines.. with routines my phone lasts throughout the day and i get 7+ hours SOT. I already have a samsung watch, Buds live and tab S6 lite so as a bonus the s20 fe completes my ecosystem perfectly too(auto switch, call and text on other devices etc). Dex mode is brilliant and my tv is now a monitor for work too. Icing on the cake is how well it integrates with my windows 11 laptop(samsung flow and link to other devides). Honestly the best purchase I've ever made. Only downside is it's official release was September 2020.. so we ll only get support uptil Android 13 and all security updates will stop by September 2024. I fully expect my phone to last until September 2024 since it's water proof and can be wirelessly charged if the charging port malfunctions so I've worked it out as rs. 34000 for 34 months which is rs. 1000 a month which is fantastic for this phone. Only con is i don't get why samsung dint put a 25w charger in the box. That being said it's better for the battery.. and i slow charge my phone for 2.30 hours every night using a smart plug so it doesn't really affect me yet(but maybe it will annoy me in 2 years when the battery will degrade). This phone is and was samsung at its best. I doubt we ll see such good value again since their pricing for their good decides isn't usually so budget friendly. 5 out of 5 starts for sure.

Best in the class under 40k
","
Overall a good smartphone with some issues not a deal breaker but you should know, Fingerprint sensor was slow compared to other smartphone in it's range, front camera was average, battery life was average it's not a bigger battery smartphone if u rough use it u have to plug it 2 times a day as this is a powerful smartphone need extra battery, and the charger gave was 15watt in the box and they claim it as fast charger, sometimes thi phone heats up quiet a bit i know it is have different 5g modem from chipset because of this, the smartphone heats up quite a bit not a deal breaker, 800nits brightness screen was not fully visible outside when sun is at the top...Back Camera was best in the class, 865 chipset was powerfull no doubt about it,This is my honest review after using this for more than 1 months. Overall a better non Chinese smartphone with some good feature...

Totally disappointed - Heats too much, wifi signals drops, battery charge drops like crazy
","
After 2 days of usage I have found out that the phone is heating up too much which is casuing it to throttle which could be the reason of Wifi network strength dropping to zero at times and at other times it fluctuates very much. It varies from 300 Mbps to 32 Mbps without the phone or router moving a bit apart, this is very strange. Also, battery drop while using the phone is also crazy 2 hours or WhatsApp chat is causing a drop of around 30%. And on raising return requests amazon is sending fools in the name of technician who run the servify app that just check whether the connectivity is there or not and the guy had not listened to my problem neither he tried any other workaround. What is strange is he marked my issue resolved despite him doing nothing except for running the checks. Again asked for return again they have scheduled the appointment for today. I Will update the feedback as it happens. But before you purchase the product please do search galaxy s20 fe 5g wifi signal issues, galaxy s20 fe 5g wifi heating issues on google and read the posts on xda and reddit.

● First, this is not a gaming phone.● Heating issues are there.● Intented to use only in indoor spaces at ambient room temperatures.● Sound: Good, tuned by Dolby Atmos but● missing the 3.5mm● Phone likely warms up even while surfing internet(thanks to Samsung's  low SAR values)● Charging and Battery. You couldn't get 30% battery left after a day's use. (Charge twice, to use once).● Camera is GOOD● UI: One UI 4.1, Android 12● Security patch: March 01, 2022

Battery drains fast

I purchase this because of the security provided by samsung.. I use net banking and use many office apps, no complains on that front.. Flagship grade cameraCons:1) Gorilla Glass 3 on S20 FE 5G where A52s gets Gorilla Glass 5..backside easily gets scratched..2) Fingerprint is slow.. Could have given ultrasonic sensor.3) 15 w charger damn slow and no extra accessories.4) should have given adaptive screen refresh, with 120 hz battery drains faster.. QHD would have made this phone great.5) No 32 bit DAC6)while uploading/downloading large file and when mirroring screen,while capturing video, the mobile gets heated up quickly..

This is an all-rounder phone with a great display, good speakers, excellent back cameras and all that comes with Samsung flagship. But one huge huge problem and a deal breaker for me is its WIFIconnectivity problem. On my WIFI network which always delivers around 100 mbps on all devices, on this phone I get only about 10-12 mbps. I found this is a problem with the entire S20 line up. Keep this in mind before buying.

Marvelous piece of work by jio and google

This phone is an excellent example of what can be achieved if smartphone maker and software company works together. Inspite of an old processor, the phone performs exceedingly beyond expectations.Pros:- Touch feels extremely smooth. I personally didn't experience any lags. I have 25+ apps installed.- Out of 2GB, 1GB+ RAM is free almost all the time inspite of multiple apps being opened. That is amazing software optimisation.- updates are automatic just like in windows PC. They Download and install in the background. You can turn off this feature in settings if you want.- speaker is loud enough.- Lot of work is put in by Google to ensure that any lag causing features are trimmed down from the phone and it has turned out well so far.Cons- Does not support screen cast. Hope they can fix this with a software update.Apart from this I cannot complain much because the hardware is cheap and old yet is feels somehow premium just because of the awesome optimisations.In short this is the best value for money. Even if you have the budget, I would still recommend to experience this gem just for its value for money proposition.

I got this phone from a local store at 6000. Internet will only work from Jio Phone on this device. Since I am a developer, I need this just as a testing device.  This device is a big failure and it sucks. It is very slow, touch screens used to be more responsive in 2010's phone than on this device. Internet works slow, it is very very very slow........ You can easily get any device much much better than this on Realme or Tecno.

Having problem with speakers in new redmi 10S phone which I purchased...  basic functionality calls not working properly at all - voice is not at all clear in between cut cut.... infact If we spend 1000 rupees & go for basic mobile  incoming & outgoing calls facility works awesome. But Redmi10S worst. Also the Redmi service center response is pathetic they are not approachable & do not accept the issue what we are facing even if we are coming up with proof. they say we have formatted software & no issue is found also they no replacement  & more over they don't even give any statement in writing verbally say no issue. We do get proof any proof for visiting Redmi service center. worst experience I faced spending 15K & buying Redmi 10S mobile. I suggest not to go for Redmi Mobile as I could see during my visit to service center many people visiting center with newly purchased mobile having one or the other issue... I will never ever suggest anybody to go for Redmi.

Dear Sir / Madam,I am writing to you to raise an issue about: Mobile Phone and accessoriesThe issue that I have experienced was: I have booked a new mobile ( Redmi Note 10 S ) dated 9th-June-2021 from Amazon and received its delivery on dated 11th-June-2021, When i start using it, I faced a voice disturbance issue initially, I cross-checked my mobile network sim car by placing it in my old phone but there is no connectivity or network issue in my sim cardThen  I tried to reach Xiaomi via their website to customer care & emailed my issue but still, there is no such positive response from their side and still, I am facing such issue

 The phone devliered with battery which is not charging after 83% [refer video ]. This is verified with 5-6 hours of opening the phone. Intially, apps from google play store also didnt get updated. I have called amazon customer care who confimed with Blannco app that battery test was failed, which confirmed issue with battery . The youtube video quality was pathetic and worse. Even though its a major product issue, not eligible for refund because it was bought in sale. The replacement shows 2-3 weeks , not sure when it will be delivered and condition of that phone.In summary:- Paid money for phone- Defective phone delivered- Pathetic and horrible youtube video quality- No refund- Replacement which might a take month- There is nothing Amazon customer care can do- If anyone still intrested buy this product , from the sellar and amazon - please reconsider , it can be extremely frustrating and mental torture to go through this.- The opinion shared based on my genuine expereince .

The phone is overall very impressive. After my first few days of basic usage, I can that it is smooth and fast with no lag. The camera is impressive in this price range. The UI is also nice and easy to use. Battery is good but not amazing. The sleek and lightweight build adds on to the value. On the whole I would say Redmi Note 10S is worth the penny.Review is based on first week of usage only.

I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera.

I can't imagine that this is Redmi phone, I am using Redmi brand from last 6 years and this is my third mobile set of Redmi.I am not satisfied and even suggest to others, don't buy any redmi more then 10k and above, its not working well in most of the parameters, so only purchase les. Then 10k price Redmi mobile, don't go much higher.I am totally dissatisfied with my latest Redmi note 10 S, if MI company give me chance I will pay and purchase Redmi 10 pro...I would not prefer 10S.So be care.....

I have compared the phone with a much lesser price Redmi note 10, In almost all factors the RMN10 is better. Am not a gaming person. Even using the camera the phone was heating. Am disappointed in buying this device. One of the worst phones I have bought from Redmi.  I have buying Redmi phones since 2015, till now I have bought 8 Redmi phones.

BRITISH RULES BEING APPLIED IN 'REPUBLIC OF INDIA'
","
1. In England. there is a Law which says you cannot record someone while talking to them on phone without taking permission. Now this is a law like 'You cannot download pirated films' , many people break this Law by downloading third party apps.2. To follow this Law, google introduced its own dialer and messaging apps. Now, in google dialer(which is present in this phone), you cannot RECORD CALLS .3. Even when you can, there are a lot of problems :-a) You can only automatically record unknown numbers. For contact, you have to select individually.b) Before recording the call, there will be a sound which says ""THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED"", which pretty much makes the call recording useless.For example, if a scammer is calling you, and you tell him that you are recording, he might cut the call.4.) The camera is good, but the QUAD CAMERA SETUP is just a numbers game at this point. The 2 megapixel camera's are mostly useless.5) Since this phone uses GOOGLE DIALER and GOOGLE MESSAGING, it is VERY DIFFICULT to transfer you old messages and call history because of SOFTWARE BUGS which no one knows when Xiaomi or Google will fix.6) The camera bumb is big, though you can get a protective cover for that.7) Overall, the specs of this phone are good. The processor is good too. But the SOFTWARE issues make it useless.8) Calling and messaging are basic functions, if a phone is bad at them, it does not matter how much FPS you get in PUBG9) I am a student and buying a phone from my parents money. So I returned this and I will buy Redmi note 9 ( a downgrade). It has the OP MIUI Dialer and Messaging. I might get 5-10 fps less in BGMI / PUPB but that is not that big of a problem.Thanks, AMAZON REVIEWER PLS ACCEPT THIS REVIEW ITS IMPORTANT OTHERWISE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RETURNING THIS PHONE

I was expecting more from MI but unfortunately, it didn't even offer what it used to. The battery life is very poor that if it's 20% 10 pm at night, in the morning I see a dead phone. The call recoding feature of the phone is also bad. With eartlier models of MI phoones, It used to record  every call seamlessly now you have to press the recoding button to get the call recorded and voice alter would also be heard to the other caller, letting him know he is being recorded. I have to charge my phone twice in a day as the batter consumption is so high despite I'm not a very active phone user.

And they recommend for replacement if they have convinced with the problem. So I have  took a day off and expected for them the whole day. But No one visited.

Redmi Note 10 is still better
","
My view here is to compare this and the Redmi Note 10. And to conclude that why note 10 still is a better buy than this:  Xaomi has increased the price of note 10 twice by 1000 rupees each. Now to appease customers through a marketing gimmick, Note10 S has been lauched to make it look like it is better than or an improved version of note 10 but sadly it is NOT. The 48 MP sony camera at the rear of note 10 is no match for the 64 MP camera in note 10S. The stabilisation, low light capabilities, the wide angle and the overall outcome is far better.  The difference in the results of processor speed is not significant!! But the Helio G95 in note 10 S is overheating when pressed.  Display is same with same gorilla class type.  Fingerprint sensor in the 10 S has poor sensitivity where the note 10 is of top notch smoothness.  So this is not at all an upgrade for Redmi note 10!! infact it is a downgrade.  Xaomi should focus on composition and value for the customers than to just keep launching diffferent models just for the sake of launching.

Starts with Intermediate reboots, blank screen, UI and other system apps stops responding, internal storage won't detect sometimes resulting reset of all applications like whatsapp.  If you are able use this phone during a call they you are lucky.

I liked almost everything about the product. The MIUI 12.5 was great and easy to use. The processor is decent for gaming. Expect around 50-60 fps while playing BGMI on Smooth + Extreme option. No complaints there. Phone charges very quickly although it heats a bit when its charging for 15+ minutes. The screen refresh rate of 60hz is fine although 90hz would have been great. I haven't used the camera much but its probably average. Don't expect a great camera out of this device.The fingerprint reader is great and passes most of the time.The only thing I disliked about the product was that the video clarity on the phone is really bad. 720p videos feel like 480p and 1080p videos feel like 720p and so on... They could have used a better quality sAMOLED screen.In the end , if I had the option to rate this phone out of 10, I would rate it a whopping 8.5. It met most of expectations and exceeded a few as well.

There is no way the phone specs are matching to the actual quality of phone.1) The display has so much contrast and even the best settings are no way equavalent to the super amoled quality MI is promising. THE IMAGES AND VIDEOS displaying in phone at very high contrast resulting in darkening of shadows. The brown color I can see in my laptop is absolute black on the phone in HD quality youtube video (up and up- by Coldplay).2) Video Call quality is so much worse even with 150Mbps internet speed3)Front Camera quality is worst. I took a picture from my redmi note 4 and redmi note 10s and I was shocked how much better the image quality of my note4 was as compared to 10s. (On reccomended Settings).4) The opening, closing and switching app time of the apps when I compared it with samsung m30s was higher. The delay in actions when you see a 6gb phone is worse in 10s.For Rs15,000 this phone is the worst. If this phone is for Rs 10,000 or less then buy it for sure. Else donot buy it.

OK, But Needs Improvement
","
This is a review of the shadow black 6GB, 128 GB model after moderately using it for 2 days...The Pros:-1. RF signal receptor: Definitely good and better than my Samsung F41, M30 as it always showed less signal bars for both VI and airtel connections at my home whereas Redmi 10S shows full signal bars. It also shows at the time of calling and browsing as the better network quality gives hd vocie clarity keeping VOLTE mode on and good mobile data speed.2. Wifi receptor:- Good again and beter than my previously used F41, M30 and Vivo Z1x as these had fluctuating signal strength shown from the wifi routers kept at a distance of 15m, but not in the case of Redmi 10S. So thumbs up to that.3. Display:- Good AMOLED display with dot hole design of front camera, brightness and colour reproduction is good as you can expect from amoled display, no complain on this front as both online and offline videos gave good quality (checked on MX player, youtube, Sony liv, Hot star)4. Sound on Stereo speakers:- This one is definitely above most of the other phones of this price segment as it got dual stereo speakers, the loudness and stereo effect is evident while playing video without headphones.5. Fingerprint Sensor : Quite good and seamlessly worked for me without even pressing the power button, I mean you can only touch the button to unlock the mobile with registered finger.6. Camera : Back and Front cameras briefly tested and found OK, I am occassional user of mobile camera so did not emphasise on it's use, however the photo clarity was good in daylight and in indoor condition as per me.7. Gaming: Quite regular with the mobile PES and that game demands resources while playing against online opponent. This mobile runs the game smoothly as expected and did not lag. However I did not use any heavier action game to check the capability of the processor..Battery Life: - What you can expect from a 5000 mAH battery. It runs for the day with good usage, that is all I needed.Cons:-1. Heating Issue: I found this mobile to be hot in the top side area beside camera assembly if I run a game or some video for some time. The heat is not too much but quite annoying to feel.2. Sound with headphones:- I found the sound though headphones (Sony) to be not much loud, the same headphone gave me better result on Vivo Z1x.3. AOD:- This one is definitely the worse I have ever seen! Always On Display is quite old feature now, have never seen any issue in my Samsung or Vivo mobiles, but this AOD on Redmi 10S never wants to stay on! It just shows for 10 seconds and then automatically turns off, This must be a software bug and can be fixed by MI in next software update I believe...Overall I am happy with the handset as it looks and feels good to hold and has all the good features you expect from a medium segment phone in the market.

Just a gimmick of amoled display, even normal lcd screen of my mom is looking better which is under 10k phone. So far best screen quality phone I've used is Samsung galaxy F62 and this is worst display I've used so far. Even there is only option to replace no return possible 😑

I research a lot before choosing a product.Finalized this device as it is best value for money.As it has dedicated SD Card slot so I have chosen 6GB / 64 GB model to save some money.I wanted:Super Amoled DisplayIR Blaster for controlling devices at home.Bigger Screen and a Processor and RAM combination to get snappy performance.If your budget is 15K then go for it.

Mobile with Poor camera, display and audio quality and fast battery drain
","
I have used 3 mi mobiles phones at my home but this is the worst mobile. I have redmi 4 which is 4-5 years old but still performs better than this and redmi note 9 pro max which is better than this. It is pathetic product from mi and I have lost the trust over the brand. They are focusing more on quantity and not on quantity now. I am really disappointed after buying this and will not suggest anyone to buy it.Camera quality - it is very poor and there is no clearity. Front camera makes pictures completely blur.Display quality - I bought this mobile after seeing one of it's highlighted feature that is amoled screen at this price but it's display quality is even worse than full hd+ lcd display. Videos and pictures doesn't look pleasant.Audio - there are dual speakers in mobile but sound starts cracking when you play something on high volume and there is no clearity in the sound. Sound over the call is also not good.Performance - First time I decided to buy meadiatek processor enables mobile but it has also disappointed me. It heats up after some time and battery drains fast as compared to my other mobile. Snapdragon processor have better power efficiency than this.Charging - Even though it have 5000 mah battery and they have have provided 33w charging but it's still slow as compared to my redmi note 9 pro max which also have 33w charger.If you want to buy redmi mobiles then only go from pro , pro max and highly budget series but don't expect much from camera.

 Ordered a Redmi Note 10s, The handset screen shut and turned  black out within 15 days of buying the product. Defected handset was delivered within 15 days of purchase.  Company service centre found major defect in handset and had changed mother board of phone. If the handset was so defected , company has to replace the phone , but they only repair it with changing the whole mother board( main board)Worst Brand policy, Dont buy this fraud brand handset which are not worth buying . Company is selling defective pieces of handset online on AMAZON.Totally dissatisfied with Amazon as well as Redmi Brand.Sharing some photos and videos of defective handset. Dont invest in this brand.

I was happy to know that hone supports 5Ghz wi-fi (5G wi-fi network). But then the next day it decided not to connect to any 5ghz network and showing them. I contacted customer service and they told me a few methods to resolve the issue - like reset network settings, do this and that - but it was no good; in the end they asked me to reset the phone. I did it, still it was not showing my 5ghz wifi. Then for one last time I decided to reset the network settings and finally it identified the 5g wifi network.Other Issue - Battery is 5000mah, but its not well optimized. It drains a little fast.There was no issue with my phone other than these, but facing such problems within 24 hours of receiving phone is a serious issue.

Good for daily tasks
","
Bought this phone since my old phone was giving me network related troubles and also the processor was not powerful enough to handle latest apps. This phone is excellent to do regular tasks like social media apps, browsing, youtube, online study etc. Processor is capable enough to handle normal tasks related to our day to day affairs.It has UFS 2.2 storage feature which makes app opening snappier. Initially I wanted to go with Moto G31 but this phone easily beats G31 in value for money department. My only concern with this phone was the ads/crapware in MiUi but surprisingly Xiaomi has manage to reduce it a lot and if you carefully disable the relevant options within the MiUi, you will not get any ads.Regarding Camera, it has average camera quality. Nothing impressive but this was expected in the price range and I'm ok with it cause I'm not a selfie shooter. I have my own DSLR which I use for any special kind of photography. Video is not that great. Its OK for one time viewing or for sharing on social media.Processor is OK. It can handle most regular daily tasks without any issues. Occasional hiccups are expected but they are understandable in terms of price-performance ratio. What surprised me is that my Mom's Redmi Note 5 has Snapdragon 625 processor which has 4K video recording but this one doesn't despite it being superior to 625 processor. It would be great if Xiaomi can enable at least 1080p/60fps in the next update.Phone has all the important sensors like gyroscope, compass etc. Many times in this prices range, gyro or compass sensor is absent which are important sensors. I use Google maps a lot for navigation so Compass comes handy to know my direction.Screen is excellent. Its on Par with 20-25K phone range. 90hz is smooth. Sunlight visibility in outdoor is great. My old phone had IPS panel which was excellent but sunlight visibility was very poor. This is just brilliant. Content watching is immersive. Also its not too big either like 6.7 inches phone which are cumbersome to carry in pants. This one is sleek looking.Battery is above average tbh. Xiaomi needs to do better optimization in this phone. Though it has 5000mah battery but optimization is poor which eats away battery even while doing normal tasks. It can survive the whole day but Xiaomi needs to think about it in the battery department. 33w fast charger is game changer. It charges phone fairly quickly. So, that balances out the optimization issue to a bit. Kudos to Xiaomi for providing ""real fast charger"" instead of supplying 15w charger and calling it ""Fast charger"".Water/Dust resistance is essential.It has Dedicated slot for SD card which is also a plus point which going for this phone. Other phones in this category have hybrid solutions or no expansion slot.Side Mounted physical fingerprint sensor works great. This is what I prefer instead of in-display optical finger print scanners.Carrier Aggregation is there. Dual 4G standby works great. I can use Vodafone 4G while JIO sim stays active. Call quality is great. Dual Speakers provide adequate loudness and speaker quality are excellent.Overall this phone serves my needs. You can weigh your requirements with pros/cons and decide it. There won't be a perfect phone in this price range but this one ticked all my requirements. Thank you Xiaomi. You sure know how to make affordable and value for money smartphones for Indian consumers.

Video quality is average.At this price it is good.Good performance. No lag issues. 90Hz refresh rate is nice. Finger print sensor is working fine.Bright Torch light. Light weight.. Easy to use in one hand.. Comfortable design. First  day I experience a delay in charging and I thought it doesn't have fast charging at all. And also there was huge heat issue during charging.Second day that problem is almost solved.. Heating problem reduced and charging also become faster.. And  4th day onwards normal heat issue only and charging become faster.Auto call recording is not there.

Redmi Note 11 review :: Camera Quality is not upto the Mark.

Advantages::* UI Display looks good.Disadvantages::* Mainly camera/video quality is not satisfied. company informed 50MP.. but pixel clarity less than 16MP.. The reason is 50MP is not default in camera view.  everytime, we have to select 50MP option.. Also no zoom option for 50MP view.. Completely unworthy cameras compare to samsung/Realme(sony camera).* When Playing game also phone got hanged frequently...* Morning you charged in , end of the day is getting completely drained..* 2 speakers sounds are little lower than other phones..* Too many advertisements.. its keep on advertising on every navigations..so, its budget phones.. targetting all middle peoples with Ads. so MI company will get more beneficial from you,. AND YOU WILL NOT BE GETTING BENEFICIAL., YOU WILL BE SEEING SO MANY ADS LIKE YOUTUBE,.Before buying, Think twice.. if you need Good quality camera/video phones, just Blindly go for Other brands like Samsung/Realme & lQOO..If you don't bother camera quality, focusing on good display & surfing YouTube & browser, you can opt this..

Though writing a review only using it for 4 days is too early, but there are few things need to be shared:Display: Excellent Display. Build quality is also good.Battery & Charging: Good battery life (24 to 36 hrs in moderate usage) & fast charging.Audio: Decent audio quality with dual speakersCamera: Good camera in daylight conditions, images are sharp & detailed... though under low light it's a bit grainy but still detailed (again other mobiles in this range also has similar problems, their softwares in order to lose the grains makes the picture soft)Video: Video is not upto the mark. It's very shaky. Must have some issues with the stabilizer.Gaming: Gaming with high graphics & for long hours is not recommended. Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 is not a heavy gaming processor(However I was playing SFA for 2-3 hours with low graphics quality & its performing fine)Heating: Till date no heating issues.

Redmi phones quality is going down with each updated model. E.g. my Note 8 has much better camera quality than my new Note 11.Further the speakers at full volume may permanently damage them (again low quality).Perhaps this is going to be my last Redmi product as I will switch to a better quality brand after 3 years (once Redmi permanently makes my phone non operational through software upgrades as it happened in two previous phones 3S Prime and Note 7).

Just don't buy it.I will update my review if any changes are observed in future.Comparing this to my 2 years old realme x2Pros - The only pro is dual speakersCons:-1. Build is inferior to realme x2.2. YouTube only supports 1080 while my earlier device supported 2160.3. Audio codec support on bluetooth ji device is SBC while my previous device supported AAC.4. Earpiece audio quality is not good too.5. Camera quality in front as well as back is not as good as my previous device.It felt like a downgrade from my previous device which had the same price and better processorI was hoping it to be having a good build like Redmi note 10 unfortunately it doesn't, currently very disappointed from Mi.There is not a option to return this product, only damaged products can be returned so I am stuck with it. Amazon should show a pop up regarding such important matters and should not hide it in some corner.Was a satisfied prime user until now but now I am questioning my choices.

Performance gets sluggish after taking calls(normal call, whatsapp call) due to CPU throttling.I have even observed CPU frequency getting stuck at 690Mhz and never coming up (Enable Developer options -> Power monitor -> Monitor Frame rate)This is a SERIOUS bug and root cause of all performance issues being faced by multiple users of RedmiNote11. In fact I am reviewing my 2nd unit after exchanging 1st unit due to performance issues.Check the attached pic how Geekbench scores vary based on which time benchmark was taken.Before the call, all good scores above 380.

Worst phone from Redmi and worst services from amazon

 I purchased this phone from  Amazon and from 5th day onwards the screens goes blank, most of the times I make a call. The phone lags a lot when compared to another phones of same spec. On contacting customer services, they say I need to send phone back to seller via courier and post that they will refund the amount. Now, I have to wait for another 2-3 days without phone until another phone is delivered.

Don't buy this buggy and pathetic phone. I am regretting
","
1. Even Redmi note 7 has 1000 time better camera optimization than this. 50MP yet images are pathetic and when you try to see images they takes time to load. Even my older phone with 20MP takes better details than this 50MP.2. Even my older phone with far less antutu score than this has better performance. This phone is not optimised. Shows lags and can't retair app memory as many times to switch to other app and when you come back it restarts that app even my older phone is better than this.3. Charging is good but battery backup is average.I will suggest you to go for realme as I am highly disappointed by buying this phone.

horrible camera don't buy if camera is important, Privacy Issue  & many more Problems in UI

1. You can't enable an Always-on display for the whole time. It will be shown only after 10 sec you turn off the screen2. Notification Sound setting is not available I can't believe you can't turn off notification sound separately in 2022 this feature is available in 2015 smartphones it is combined with ringtone sound you have to silent your whole phone If You don't want notification sound definitely Then you are going to miss the calls then because vibration is not strong during ringing but in other cases typing taping vibration fell very strong3. Focus mode is a joke In this phone you will still get notification from focus mode itself if someone Texted you on WhatsApp or any other app send you a notification it will not show from which app it's coming but it's still annoying What the point of focus mode if I am getting notification from focus mode itself4. BIG PRIVACY ISSUE - there is an app called security app I don't know why smartphones need this kind of app in 2022 what's the point of a smartphone anyway this app takes your all permission all means all location, camera, call logs, file & storage everything but you can't disable it and can't uninstall it

Worst Phone ever. 😞
","
Bought this phone at 16k and wasted my Money.1. Camera:Front camera is worst camera ever in any phone under even 10k  13MP Camera looks like 1.3MP VGA camera that comes in 1k Feature Chinese phones while video calls even if you use Fiber 100mbps or 1gbps connection.Back camera is 50MP but in Indoor it's like old 5MP in Only work good in Sunlight and outdoor good lighting conditions otherwise don't expect much it's badest 50MP camera.Max resolution for video recording is only 1080p 30fps ..... old Realme 6 can record 1080p 60fps 4k 30fps  and compare the price of both. This Redmi Note 11 Even doesn't support 1080p 60fps Only 30fps is max option in this why it have an new processor if old one is powerful. This phone is completely Downgrade on any phone you currently have right now. Even from 2017 ....2. Performance:  As per the specs on paper it mentioned SD 680 in it and it's poor processor and even MediaTek G85 works better than this shit.It take longer time to capture and preview picture in galley after we take a photo in camera. And phone even didn't support Some apps properly Like vidmate kinemaster and few other apps it just automatically close apps after sometime while using and kinemaster just open only 1st time 2nd it start crashing and that was not app issue it's phone issue itself.3. Software:  Only one thing i want to say is Now i figured out why it called a MeMe Ui ........Lags a lot. Hangs like 10 years old phone.4. Display: Yeah Good but 60hz looks like 30hz and 90hz looks like 60hz so No reason to spend Money for 90hz screen .....  Buy any other good phone with 60hz it will be lot better than this 90hz .....5. Battery:I haven't used phone much because of these issues so i wanted to Return and Get Refund buy amazon Rejected .....  Battery maybe a good in this phone but for how ""long""So, My opinion on this phone is if you get it under 10k than ok but if you you can use it  with those issues i have mentined above otherwise not worth to buy...""Say No To This Phone"" Don't waste Your Money on This Device it will not work properly. And can't satisfy and Normal User.For camera Users Don't buy it .... If you use camera in Low Light conditions than Don't waste your money on this phone better to buy Any other phone but not This.Do Not Buy this 👎

Nothing special in this phone. Not worth for the price tag. It should be 10k. Weight is less. That's it. Front camera is very very very worst. Taking pic is different, auto beautify is different. So the end result is very worst image. Even if u turnoff beautify it won't. I am a Normal user. Battery drain very fast even u r not use. Max 1 day it will come. But the only good thing is it took 1-1.15 hours for charging. Thank God.. Don't think much about 5G. Even 4G is not getting properly other than metropolitan. So that's ok. If u want any phone u can go for this. Don't expect much.. Thankyou

There are too many bugs and glitches in this device. It lags every now and then. There have been two system updates sience i bought this device and none of them fixed the problem. Dialer is one of the biggest problems because every time i open the dialer there is at least 3 sec. Lag. Its very frustating. Camera quality is not very good. And heating problem is also there. So if yoh are are a very light user (you dont use too many apps) and dont click too many picture and you don't get frustated by 3 sec lag of dialer ever single time you want to call somebody then you can go for it. Otherwise dont.

I purchased it for my father. It's great, working smoothly and what else would we need. I mean it's a normal phone with better display and carrier aggregation. However, let's not set the expectations so high. If you are buying the phone for camera, you can go for high end Samsung, Apple or even OnePlus device that will cost you 40k + for a decent phone from those companies. But buying this phone and complaining that camera is not on par with DSLR is something hilarious. For my father, it's a great phone. Display is the primary highlight.

It is an average performance device and at some part it performs below average.Pros:-Dual speakers.-90 hz Amoled display-50mp camera- miui 13 (android 11) out of the box.- 1gb more memory extension in 4gb ram device- quite light phone.- battery Is best.Cons :- Processor : it makes the phone perform similar to redmi cheaper ₹7000-₹9000 phones.- Display : Avg quality amoled display although the brightness is very good it does not feel as crisp as my note 10 pro also you can't play HDR videos on it and no 4k video support.- Audio : no Dolby Atmos support and those who use note 10 pro knows how much it affects the sound (i.e. takes it from avg to good quality loudspeaker experience)- Camera : it says 50mp and shots do come out quite good but that is during sufficient lighting only and image quality takes a huge toll in slightly poor lighting conditions.I bought it for my mother and for her the YouTube Facebook and Instagram work fine audio is sufficiently loud.Also remember to buy the insurance at least for screen damage as it is amoled display and could cost you high during repairs.

RN 11 is a good phone at 12499, the display is superb. Battery backup is very good thanks to 6nm processor.

This is my 6th phone from MI/Redmi Series.I have seen many phones before buying this. Finally selected this one bcz it meets all that I wanted.1. I need an IR blaster. (other than MI phones I did not find this great feature)2. Audio/Video for calls and its quality/call recording (Excellent)3. Smooth/bright/sunlight/outdoor display (Excellent)4. Dual Speaker (top and bottom) and sound clarity is one of the best ( Excellent)5. 6GB/128GB + 33W charger + 90hrz ( best  in this price range)6. Comfort in hand and also in the pocket.+ The camera quality is enough for me, satisfied with this price range.+ I charge once and use it all day. A one-time charge is enough for a FULL DAY..+ No heating problem.Got everything I need and gave it 5 stars, totally satisfied.It seems MI knows what Indians want, coming up with good low budget phones and trying to giveas best possible features are possible in that price range.Huff...never understand how someone buys an Apple phone for 70,000+ rupees or even more.TIP: We should not use an always-on display and animations and a high refresh rate to keep the batteryhealthy for all day.Amazon delivered in 6hr. and got a 1000 rupees discount with CC. Completely satisfied. Thank you.

Not that great! Fingerprint sensor on the right side of the phone is the biggest disappointment out of all! Just a light touch will open it plus the location of the sensor is the most common place to touch. Secondly, the notifications are completely useless I can never pickup a call on time because it keeps on disappearing whenever I try to click, same goes for reminders and alarms. Also, the back of the phone gets easily scratched. If you're buying it on budget then it's okay but if you want a good smartphone with great technology this phone is not it!

Pros1)Amoled Display, Great for multimedia watching.2) Supports Carrier Aggregation i.e 4G+ singals3) IP 53 Rating.. no worries of phone damage due to rain, splash of water.4) Stereo speakers are loud and clear, no distortion even at highest volume. Balance between speakers is off but still considering price no complaints5) Widevine L1 certified, Can watch Full HD Content on streaming services6) Future Android Updates to Android 12 and 13, security updates till Jan 20257) IR Blaster.. Use phone to control electronic appliances such as TV, DTH Set top Box, ACs etc8) UFS 2.2 storage.. much faster than eMMC storage used by many mid range devices.9) Excellent battery life, easily lasts whole day and two days if usage is light10) 33 watt fast charging, charges phone in 1 hour 15 minutes.11) Brightness is good even under direct sunlight.12) No heating issues, some phones get warm even during calls.13) It supports Alexa Hands free.. really useful while driving.14) Fingerprint reader, Face unlock works well15) No issues in call qualityCons.Cons are mostly software based and can be fixed via update.1) Auto Brightness issue.Phone brightness increase automatically under sunlight but in darker situations the brightness stays low andi have to manually increase brightness.2) I Have 6 GB ram model and even then some background apps are closed by the system.3) Always on display feature is only for 10 seconds.4) Cameras are average (OK for basic use)// I do not game on phones so can't comment on gaming performance. In regular use phone is fast// For Ads free experience watch youtube videos ( I have not seen single ad on my device till now)// For people living in metro cities consider buying 5g phone. Rural areas can buy this one as 5g will take some timeVerdict:- Best all rounder phone in budget with minor software bugs which i expect to be resolved considering this phone will get android 12 and 13..

This is a good phone at 13k and better than Samsung phones under 20k.Camera is quite good. The uwa camera is 8 mp which is decent. Added photos of uwa,wa and 2x zoom. Clearly better than previous Samsung M21 I had. And does not kill the images by oversharpening like Samsung did.Pro mode allows full control. camera2api fully supported (level 3). Overall 5/5 for cam.Calling and network seems ok. SAR 0.85 which is better than many other phonesAudio 5/5 - has stereo speakers with some bass and quite loud, 3.5mm jack and sound through headphones is excellent.Battery lasts more than 2 days for me as I only do calls, use camera sometimes and listen to music. The 5000 mah battery somehow lasts longer than the 6000 one in Samsung.Comes with all sensors and fm radio.MIUI 13 - liking it so far. Coming from one ui 3.1 and stock Android before that, my opinion is that they were clean and simple but lack some useful features. MIUI is more customizable and useful.No heating or lagging issues so far but I dont play games, so cant comment on that.Overall complete package with 33w charger and back silicon case screen protector, unlike recent Samsung phones which removed charger and put a usb c to usb c cable so that some people are still forced to buy chargers.Also no 5G which is good for price reduction. By the time 5G gets available properly the prices will reduce.

I didn't like it! I had used redmi note 8 pro previously, so It's display got damaged and I bought this, this is not good, made for people like our parents and grandparents! It doesn't support HDR videos playback, no 60fps recording at 1080p, the camera has good focus control in video recording but lot of frame drops at high quality and over sharpening! The camera captures true to life colours in well lit conditions but very soft image looks blurry and not at all close to sharp..! Single flash, 90hz doesn't make much difference It's still useless! Phone feels stuttering! No ram management! No split screen, no good gaming! Good stereo speakers available, super tight headphone jack (you may end up damaging your earphones), the camera is like samsung camera, it's very white, cartoonish, blunt images (need stable hands), the pro mode had lots of settings, ulta wide is bad, macro is super ultra garbage useless!!!, Front is not good at all just for name sake it's there, good case and in hand feel, super slow unlocks with biometrics, fast charging is good, enhanced cooling doesn't work heating issues observable, battery backup not good, for so much efficiency, the battery backup is very poor, the phone is very useless and not value for money, it has more cons than pros!After a month of use! I even thought of testing it with an actual samsung phone.. in that case I had my dad's Samsung galaxy j6 4gb varient. I was shook!!! The 6 year old much smaller device performed better! Although it had a bit higher saturation... But it produced better contrast for almost everytime against redmi note 11 and also the biggest shocking result was the difference between human faces! The redmi's output was blunt and soft and even everywhere while an American face looked completely wheatish - white on the redmi, the same face on Samsung had more details about the pale spots on the face, the redness, the pink, (the overall contrast on the image display was so much impressive on Samsung! Even though redmi uses a samsung panel, the GPU on this phone is garbage!!!Do not consider!!!

Same with all apps.2. All camera are very poor quality3. Too much google bloatware. Google trying to take over your life4. Security issues.  IPhone and samsung are way better5.

According to my usage pattern, I'm not a gamer. This is so far my experience with this handset:Pros:1. Everyday tasks run smooth since it support 90HZ refresh rate.2. The AMOLED looks good not the best color accuracy though.3. Great battery life. 33W charger charges the phone in 1-1.15 hrs.4. 6nm SD 680 Processor dissipates less heat.5. Less weight + Small screen size = Great in hand feel.6. Good haptics. Stereo speakers (Incorrectly balanced).7. Great custom rom support if you hate MIUI.Cons:1. Below average cameras (Front+back).2. Lags and jitters in the UI.3. Ads everywhere (Enabled by default). Lots of bloatware (Can be uninstalled).4. Poor software update cycle.5. Underperforms in gaming (PUBG+COD).6. Occasional proximity sensor issues.7. Adaptive brightness is very bad.Overall a good device for the price I got. But definitely not reliable for long term use unless you can flash custom ROMs..

After 3 days use .. i think my old Samsung mobile is better than this...Problems :1. Major problem is at incoming call.. screen wont switch off even if power button is pressed.All mobiles i have used screen will turn off as soon as power button is pressed if we dont want to take incomming call...but this mobile screen will be always on and it will accidentally accept the incoming call if its inside pocket ... very bad ..2. Camera quality is bad..and  50mp camera is not recognized by apps like doc scanner apps it will be only activated inside stock camera app..And doc scanner apps only see 8mp camera as primary scanner to take photos..very bad...3. Heating issues .. i thought that being snapdragon chip heating will be negligible ..but we can feel the heat .. same as samsung mobiles ..4. This mobile is using AI proximity sensor..it like a virtual device ..real hardware is not present..may be this is causing incomming call screen problem...i am switching back to my old mobile and wait for some updates before using it .. very bad..Redmi is releasing mobiles without proper testing..

The phone is good (I've 6+64 Black one). MI has increased the power efficiency, display quality, and camera from the older version keeping in mind the way it'd do wonders for business work although as expected the processor is on a downside.It'd have been awesome if a glass back was there and sd695 would've been fitted but 14.5k is a fair price for the released product no doubt but upgrading it from RN4 was a big loss for me personally.Issues:1. The left speaker (on the top) is producing a lower sound as compared to the right one (below). Balancing it in the setting would do the job but please update it in the next software upgrade.2. GPS location is not getting accurate. It's about 200m-1000m inaccurate. (Thinking about replacing it).

Don't buy this phone.. replacement and refund Options are not available.. product is too worst.. camera quality is not Good. Even amazon knows about this product that's why they don't want to get this product back from customer. This will be my last purchase with amazon.. Indians should not support this foreign company.. Earning from us.. incase of replacement they will ask us to read policy. Bye amazon..

You get what you pay for but camera is trash.
","
I'm writing this review after one month of usage. Got it at sale for 13k.Pros:- Good 90hz Amoled screen at this price. One the cheapest Amoled phone.Well that's it.Cons:- Terrible camera. (Yes, I know I can't expect a pro like camera at this price point) but both the the cameras are literal piece of trash. They pixelate the videos. Photo quality is below 7-8k price phones. My 2016 budget Lenovo phone (14k) clicks 10 times better photos and 20 times better selfie. And 100 times better videos. (No exaggeration). If you are going to buy it, then buy it thinking it's a camera-less phone.Other details:- Virtual RAM is mentioned 2gb on 6gb ram phone but I got only 1gb VRAM.Loaded with bloatware. But it's acceptable as it's a budget phone. Weight is pretty heavy. Processor is not that good but considering the price point. It's okay.

Best Phone in Low budget.

After using it for  more than 1 month-Camera: I installed Gcam and it captured very well details and colors. Really Gcam does a miracle. You will also get 60fps video recording option in Gcam.  And it also improves video stabilization. Videos comes good in day light.Performance: I am not a heavy gamer. So it's very good for daily tasks and doesn't hang often.Battery: It's a boss. I get more than 12 hrs of backup instead of heavy usage. I watch videos, use social media and for study purpose. And the charger is really fast it will charge 90 % in 50 minutes. After that it will take 15 -20 min for remaining 10 % charging. But it sometimes charges slowly. I think it's a software issue.FingerPrint: I didn't like it. It is slow and sometimes doesn't unlock ur phone.Speaker: Best in this price range. loud , n crisp sound.Display: you will love the colors while watching movies.Pros: 3 card slot, iR blaster, dual speakers, 90hz amoled display.Cons: no notification light, sometimes slow charging speed, night videos shots not good.

All good except call quality !!!
","
Pros - Good Display , Good battery , Fast fingerprintsCons - Garbage Call quality , below Average CameraI had purchased this product for my father but now he's not using it because of its rubbish call quality, like the earpiece speaker is so low that if you are outdoor then you won't able to hear the person on the other side and even the speaker volume for call is very low.Cameras on other hand are also very average , It captures smoothened photos that lack details in day light and during low light the phone struggles to capture to the details there too.Sometimes the colors are also washed out !I don't know what Redmi is doing with this !!

Not worth for a 14K Purchase.

I purchased this note 11 6GB/64GB at 14499 Rs as an upgrade to my redmi note 8. But I am totally disappointed.The worst part is the front camera. No way near to my old device's picture quality. With indoor lighting, it would be a total disaster. Also, the AI option is not available with the front camera.I was excited about the Alex app integration, but it always gets stuck and needs re-install/re-register to make it work.The battery lasts for 12 hours, if you keep it on standby, else it won't.  33W charger is good.The display and dual speaker are okay, but not a wow experience.Even with a 6GB RAM, I don't see any performance difference.
"
2176,B09QS9CWLV,"
DON'T buy if you want a good Camera.

PROS:Battery: It lasts more than a day and charges in around 1 hour 15 minute.Display: Yes, The display is really good and has very good brightness level.Speaker: It's loud and clear. It has dual speakers.CONS:Processor: Daily tasks are easily handled but not suitable for gaming. Yes, You can do moderate gaming though. But overall the phone feels bit laggy.Camera: A big NO NO. Average camera, Edges are not clear and video is more worse than the camera.CONCLUSION: If you want to buy it for your parents or someone of older age then go for it but You are into too much of gaming, Photos and all stuffs then Don't but it !

A moderately priced mid range phone with Amoled display which is probably it's USP.Performance is okay for light users, definitely not suitable for gamers or heavy users.Camera is poor, at par with phones under 10k.Android 11 from the box, haven't received update so far. Hoping to get atleast 2 major updates in the near future.Charging time more than an hour but that's acceptable for the price range and battery size.Will recommend this phone to users who like Amoled display and smooth operation, if camera and gaming/high performance is your priority than this phone is not the best in the range.

I use this phone for 10 days and it performs very well. It's camera is decent in good light conditions, not so good in low light conditions. Camera app is full of features. Battery stands one day easily with gaming. I played BGMI, and it performs very good in BGMI but graphics are only upto balance(medium) and smooth(high) not HD. Display is very good in 90hz and 60hz both. And it's also very bright in sunlight. It's colours are very good. Overall a above average allrounder smart phone. And best phone for medium usage in this range and segment😊.

Pros1. Amoled Display with 90Hz Refresh Rate which is quite good.2. Z-Axis Linear Vibration Motor.3. Stereo speakers.4. Good battery Backup with fast charging support.Cons1. 4K videos can be played in Redmi note 4 but Redmi note 11 doesn't support 4K Vidoes.2. Not support LDAC and AAC Audio Codes, but only SBC Codes.3. Noticed that some colors are unbalanced and much saturated while playing videos, and it looks pathetic.4.

A product which gave issues rather than features
","
The first week usage was quite normal and there was not a single hint of problems. But with time, I started to notice some bugs which I thought was caused by software issues and could be fixed through an minor update. As days passed the issues got bad such as Delayed call notification,disappearance of call logs,and worst of all sudden blinking of display (""On-Off issue"") that stays for 15-20 minutes whenever happens.Even the quality of the camera doesn't stand upto the mark as the videos I capture seems to contain lots of noise and grains. Also the Ram management and the refresh rate is not quite perfect, it looks like the features were just part of the overhyped marketing and was not actually put in the device as I use it in my everyday life. Therefore I am really disappointed with this device performance and totally irritated by the issues that keeps accelerating as time passes.

Review after 10days of usage: I am really disappointed with the camera quality. The primary camera is good under sunlight but the rest are useless.Charging is really fast. The size of the phone makes it easy to grasp. For a person who doesn't play games, the phone is somewhat ok. The phone seems to have a tendency to heat up during video calls.

Didn't expect much from it and came out as just a good fit for my expectation. Clean UI and sufficiently smooth at per with its configurations except some minor lags and freezes. The horrible part of the phone comes with its customizability and scope of privacy. It comes with a bunch of preloaded and useless apps that you can't even uninstall. And it also downloads ad-funded apps in the background without your consent. I personally feel it's horrible to use a phone that has its free will as if I'm don't at all own it. Thankfully I'll only be using it only to keep my standby SIM going. So not a big deal for me. But anyone who wants to use it as your primary phone rest assured you are gonna hit by a lot of adware attacks.

Smart option compared to pro model

Upgraded for iPhone XR. Battery lasts almost the same as XR but iPhone adapts as per usage over time so it will take time. Which anyways it lasts me for around 1.5 day with normal use and data services and location services always on. Do check the YouTube video to make necessary changes in settings for battery optimisation. Nothing beats the camera performance and let alone the video performance. Phone factor (rectangular edges) feels good to hold however even the MagSafe back cover when put on ruins the fun. Instead try buying a thin screen guard for back of the phone and tempered glass for the front glass as both front and back of the phone seem to be delicate and a costly affair when planning repairs. Overall the performance is great. The backup for Mini is pathetic, buy only if you have very minimal use of the phone. If a telephoto photography doesn’t seem to be on your agenda then this is a smart choice over the pro model.

I used to use an Android phone till 2014 and wanted to switch to iOS, so the same year I bought iPhone 6, It was good to have an iOS device and the performance and the cameras but those were sufficient only until next year when 6s launched. Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but couldn't buy them somehow. I wasn't and I'm not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn't eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I'm quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.When it comes to iPhone 12, it's a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I'm gonna used to of it.I bought a 128 GB device as per my requirement and colour white because finger prints on back are not visible, compared to other darker colours.INR 3000₹ Discount on the colour white, plus 6000₹ HDFC instant discount. Effective price 76000₹. Unfortunately Charging Brick isn't included and it coasted 1900₹ more for 20W USB-C from Apple India website.Overall it's a great device and satisfied purchase but overpriced for sure.

This is my first iPhone purchase , coming from oneplus 7 I don't have any regrets about the switch. Yes the switch was painful (especially because I lost all my whatsapp chats) but is worth it. comparing to oneplus 7, this phone has all features from it but in better form. My OP7 was smooth, fast had good battery camera,battery and  haptics. iPhone is just way smoother,fast and have great camera,battery and haptics. There is a slight learning curve. took 2 days to get used to gestures and navigations but is smooth sailing. the only negative feedback would be no charger in the box. You will have to get from apple.com if you want fast 20W one.

Huge leap for the standard iPhone

Upgraded from an iPhone 7 32 gigs to iPhone 12 . After holding out for a long time the upgrade was worth it. All the feature set display, camera, speakers, signal reception, chipset is a huge upgrade. Recommended if you happen to have a device from 2016 or older. This device will be the new standard iPhone for the next 4 years. So worth it if you get it now.

Now it's almost more than 2 weeks of usage and I'm fully satisfied with the performance. Earlier I was using oneplus 6T and after malfunction of the screen, i decided to move to Iphone. Before buying i had done all the R&D. Many of reviews says that it has bad battery life and couldn't stand a day. But as per my usages my battery stays all day long. I used to make call (6 to 7 hours), video, music, surfing everything except game and battery last upto 24 hours with data mode on.In my opinion its worth buying.

It’s my first iPhone ever and I bought it with my earned money through part time jobs in college✌️I am a tech freak so you can trust my views -- A14 Bionic is the fastest, most efficient and reliable processor till date- The camera focuses so quickly that you can take DSLR quality photos.- The screen size 6.1 inches is the most comfortable screen size out there and the OLED retina XDR display is so crisp and everything feels real.- The stereo speakers are so clear even on high volume and gives awesome vibe while listening to music- iOS has no bugs at all- 20W charging is lit 🔥- The Face ID feels like having no lock for yourself, there’s no issue while using Face ID even in the dark because it uses infrared rays to scan the faceDrawbacks -- Battery could be better

I just bought iPhone 12 recently and my experience is average( As I had bought it for an experience, not to show-off).Pros: Built is great, the camera is much better,  touch is good, face detection is goodCons: Overpriced, average battery life, non-availability of all the android apps, you need to buy a charger, headphones etc separately. Only one type of wired headphones is available. The biggest problem is that I can not create a separate folder for the Camera and the list is still on

Awesome phone, smoothest lightning speed. Great camera and retina scan sensor works smoothly as well

The screen quality is good :- Compared to my Galaxy A50, the screen quality of iPhone is betterCamera is superrr:- No camera is best than iPhone, the camera is better than iPhone 11Face ID is great :- calls get low tuned just when you look at the screen even without touching the phone as in phone understands that you've looked at the screen (shows a good example of Retina scan)Battery :-  is a bit issue as it drains fastApart from battery, the phone is AWESOMESecure and fast

Due to low battery always be in mind but if you leave that top notch smartphone A14 bionic chip🙌
","
So till now what concerns me is only the battery and everything by far is top notch and I was a little hesitating before purchasing it since this was my first interaction with the iOS environment but now I am used to it and works fine. Since I am not a fan of too much customization so for me this UI is totally fine. Plus gaming experience was also good till now I played nfs no limit and it works like a champ. I also really like it's ram working since my app in background keeps running without always reloading it when again opened.One last since I haven't used 120 Hz refresh rate so I can’t tell about it but since my old phone was also no having it so for me it's awesome👌.Camera is also awesome till now I haven't used it much due to covid but in low light it worked too good no doubt about it:).Hope this will help someone😁

I've always wanted to get a S Series flagship. I have always wanted to get a Note Series flagship. Now I have both of them in the S22 Ultra.After a long wait, Samsung finally merged the S and Note series which was inevitable and I am glad they did.The S22 Ultra is the phone to beat this year. Samsung launched the S series earlier than expected and we have already got a phone of the year contender 3 months into the year. Don't think it gets any better than this no matter what flagship any competition introduces.Before this, I was using One Plus 7 Pro and the S22 Ultra makes it feel like a Xiaomi phone. I was not ready to be blown away considering that OP7P is a pretty good phone to begin with. But it improves on every aspect of a 2-3 year old flagship and this is Android at it's peak (until Samsung comes out with another banger next year)It goes without saying that the camera on S22 Ultra is the highlight followed by the S-Pen. And the conversation cannot be considered over until we mention the 100x zoom. I am amazed every time I do comparison shots where I take a normal picture and then a 100x zoom and find a detail which is not possible to see with the naked eye. I'll let you be the judge after going through the pictures I have uploaded (the pigeon vs the park).The display puts other mobile based OLED screens to shame. It is difficult to describe in words and you will have to see it for yourself, but the colors, sharpness of the text, adaptive refresh rate, QHD+ resolution is a sight to behold if you don't care about the battery life (which I don't) and I chose to not make any compromises with my experience of using this phone.The S-Pen which a lot of people have said to be a gimmick is a very nice addition and I find myself using it more often than not while browsing internet or simply watching YouTube. I really like the ""Smart Select"" feature which enables you to take screenshots and crop pictures on the fly. Definitely been using it a lot more than I should.There are a lot more detailed reviews out there which would tell you the specs and other features, but you probably don't need to know all the technical aspects of it. All you need to know is this is a- Snapdragon version- Has an updated GPU (gaming performance has vastly improved if you are into mobile gaming)- S-Pen latency has vastly improved- 45W fast charging (get a charging brick from Samsung, or any reputed third party like Spigen)All in all, if money is not an object and you want a phone which provides an uncompromising experience. This is the way.

A great phone to restart broken relationship
","
I have had my relationship broken with Samsung 12 years ago because of the unethical behaviour of their service center staff. The staff broke my phone after an argument when they were not able to fix an issue in the new phone even after 3 visits. And, Samsung did nothing even after filing a complaint.In last 12 years I have used 14 major flagship devices from different companies. But didn't bought any Samsung goods.Today, after 12 years I dicided to give second and last chance to Samsung. Pre-booked this phone. Hope this will be good experience now.Here is my observation after using this device a few days.Pros:1. Awesome build quality.2. Camera (and zoom) is next level3. Speakers are loud with quality sound.4. Good network modem. My iPhone 13 struggles to get network coverage inside the home but there are full signals in Samsung phone from the same network operator.5. S pen is great addition to the S series and it works really well and fast.6. Display is really smooth and awesome7. Very touch sensitive.8. One UI seems to be promising.9. And finally, it does include the Snapdragon processor in India unit this time instead their inferior Exynos processor which helps in improving battery life and image processing.Cons:1. Doesn't come up with charging adapter. In the name of environment they fool customers to buy chargers saperately to make some extra bucks.2. Having a case inside box would have been nice like OnePlus provides one.3. There was no screen protector applied to tne display. So if you want to protect screen from the day 1, buy 1 screen protector along with the phone.4. Slower than last gen OnePlus 9 pro (12GB - 256GB). I compared keeping them side by side and disappointed by the Samsung in terms of App installation speed and gaming performance.

 This is truly the best phone money can buy, especially if you are already in the Android ecosystem. The  S22 Ultra is an amped-up Galaxy Note with a faster S Pen built in, lots of camera improvements, a brighter display and faster charging.This is a stellar phone overall. S Pen is more responsive, as Samsung made it 70% faster with less latency.Galaxy S22 Ultra's biggest upgrades come with its cameras, as Samsung is shooting to overtake the iPhone 13 Pro Max and Google Pixel 6 Pro as the best camera phone.Key features I love:Best phone display yet: The Galaxy S22 Ultra's AMOLED panel is not only brighter than the competition, making it ideal for outdoor viewing, it delivers better color saturation.The S Pen is better: By reducing the latency by 70%, writing and drawing on the Galaxy S22 Ultra feels as smooth as pen and paper. And there's a holster built in.Better photos (especially in low light): Thanks to a bigger main sensor, the Galaxy S22 Ultra delivers brighter pictures than the S21 Ultra, and the Night Mode works even better than the iPhone 13 Pro Max in certain scenarios.Longer support: Samsung is promising five years of update support and four years of major OS updates, so this flagship should be able to last you a long time.Sleek and durable design: The Galaxy S22 Ultra is protected by an armor aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus+ back, and yet it's lighter than the iPhone 13 Pro Max without a lame notch. Some may not dig the curved display, though.45W charging is fast (but not that fast): The phone got to 67% in 30 minutes, which is not that much faster than 25W (58%).

Overheating is the only issue I can see on the product.Other than that its really good. S Pen is just awesome. Camera is one of the best you can get on the market. But battery life and overheating might put you in trouble if you are a heavy user.So go for it or not?That depends,if you want value for money then go for Pixel 6 Pro. This one its the best you can get for this heavy price. But according to features like S Pen and camera this one is also good. With the offer its perfect purchase.

 Let me start with my review as I migrated from Apple ecosystem and post experience I would say Samsung S22 ultra is a marvel of engineering. I had purchased this my phone early bird offer and still falling in love of the design, curves, precision and fluidic OneUI by Samsung.Hardware:World leading SoC make Samsung 22 Ultra to perform like a beast during multi tasking.Camera placements are stunning and industry first sensor and brings every one's attention towards the device.Highest ever brightness display feel same for my vision and Dynamic AMOLED exhibits vision as super true vision.S Pen - Ahh Spen !!! signature and adds a jewel value to the phone and I feel to always use Samsung s22 with Spen45W - Charger I used for my Samsung S22 Ultra is a power house and uses every cell of Lithium to give a truly maximum standby and usage time.Software:OneUI - Cute, Fluidic, top notch features covered by the Software of Samsung which is one of the leading mobile software in the universe.Camera - I still feel jaw dropped on the camera performance on the precision shots, deep zoom shots and ultra wide experience. This shows the maximum expertise of the R&D division of Samsung's excellence which none other manufacturer like Apple, OnePlus cant even reach near. Super flawless.Samsung S22 Ultra is an engineering, photography marvel of the universe and I would say this is one of the best decision to purchase Samsung S22 Ultra in my lifetime.. Proud to recommend for new buyers.

I have observed some display color density issues with written words as i scroll the pages.The words become thick and darker as you touch the screen ,becoming normal as you remove finger touch from phone.This is very irritating, giving headache.I have observed this thing for the first time in a Samsung flagship. There are no such issues with my Note 10 plus.I have seen this issue with some cheap phones,but for God sake this is the flagship from Samsung,with this price you expect nothing but perfection.I have put a return/replacement request,so some technician will visit and see my phone.I will let you all know the result of this inspection ,whether he tries to solve the problem or pushes me to accept the phone by accepting the inconvenience.Update 1-The technician was very cordial,listened to my complaints and made a report,on the basis of which my replacement request has been accepted.Great experience!I will update my star ratings again after i receive the replacement.Update 2- I received the replacement and it is working perfectly fine.My final review is here now.Amazon delivery and problem solving 5/5The Seller Appario retail 5/5Phone looks and display 10/5Performance 5/5Battery 4/5Camera 5/5I have updated my star ratings to 5/5 now.This phone is a thing of beauty!

A great phone to restart broken relationship
","
I have had my relationship broken with Samsung 12 years ago because of the unethical behaviour of their service center staff. The staff broke my phone after an argument when they were not able to fix an issue in the new phone even after 3 visits. And, Samsung did nothing even after filing a complaint.In last 12 years I have used 14 major flagship devices from different companies. But didn't bought any Samsung goods.Today, after 12 years I dicided to give second and last chance to Samsung. Pre-booked this phone. Hope this will be good experience now.Here is my observation after using this device a few days.Pros:1. Awesome build quality.2. Camera (and zoom) is next level3. Speakers are loud with quality sound.4. Good network modem. My iPhone 13 struggles to get network coverage inside the home but there are full signals in Samsung phone from the same network operator.5. S pen is great addition to the S series and it works really well and fast.6. Display is really smooth and awesome7. Very touch sensitive.8. One UI seems to be promising.9. And finally, it does include the Snapdragon processor in India unit this time instead their inferior Exynos processor which helps in improving battery life and image processing.Cons:1. Doesn't come up with charging adapter. In the name of environment they fool customers to buy chargers saperately to make some extra bucks.2. Having a case inside box would have been nice like OnePlus provides one.3. There was no screen protector applied to tne display. So if you want to protect screen from the day 1, buy 1 screen protector along with the phone.4. Slower than last gen OnePlus 9 pro (12GB - 256GB). I compared keeping them side by side and disappointed by the Samsung in terms of App installation speed and gaming performance.

Truly Ultra To Rule Every Other Phone - Epitome of Innovation

 This is truly the best phone money can buy, especially if you are already in the Android ecosystem. The  S22 Ultra is an amped-up Galaxy Note with a faster S Pen built in, lots of camera improvements, a brighter display and faster charging.This is a stellar phone overall. S Pen is more responsive, as Samsung made it 70% faster with less latency.Galaxy S22 Ultra's biggest upgrades come with its cameras, as Samsung is shooting to overtake the iPhone 13 Pro Max and Google Pixel 6 Pro as the best camera phone.Key features I love:Best phone display yet: The Galaxy S22 Ultra's AMOLED panel is not only brighter than the competition, making it ideal for outdoor viewing, it delivers better color saturation.The S Pen is better: By reducing the latency by 70%, writing and drawing on the Galaxy S22 Ultra feels as smooth as pen and paper. And there's a holster built in.Better photos (especially in low light): Thanks to a bigger main sensor, the Galaxy S22 Ultra delivers brighter pictures than the S21 Ultra, and the Night Mode works even better than the iPhone 13 Pro Max in certain scenarios.Longer support: Samsung is promising five years of update support and four years of major OS updates, so this flagship should be able to last you a long time.Sleek and durable design: The Galaxy S22 Ultra is protected by an armor aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus+ back, and yet it's lighter than the iPhone 13 Pro Max without a lame notch. Some may not dig the curved display, though.45W charging is fast (but not that fast): The phone got to 67% in 30 minutes, which is not that much faster than 25W (58%).

Overheating is the only issue I can see on the product.Other than that its really good. S Pen is just awesome. Camera is one of the best you can get on the market. But battery life and overheating might put you in trouble if you are a heavy user.So go for it or not?That depends,if you want value for money then go for Pixel 6 Pro. This one its the best you can get for this heavy price. But according to features like S Pen and camera this one is also good. With the offer its perfect purchase.

 Let me start with my review as I migrated from Apple ecosystem and post experience I would say Samsung S22 ultra is a marvel of engineering. I had purchased this my phone early bird offer and still falling in love of the design, curves, precision and fluidic OneUI by Samsung.Hardware:World leading SoC make Samsung 22 Ultra to perform like a beast during multi tasking.Camera placements are stunning and industry first sensor and brings every one's attention towards the device.Highest ever brightness display feel same for my vision and Dynamic AMOLED exhibits vision as super true vision.S Pen - Ahh Spen !!! signature and adds a jewel value to the phone and I feel to always use Samsung s22 with Spen45W - Charger I used for my Samsung S22 Ultra is a power house and uses every cell of Lithium to give a truly maximum standby and usage time.Software:OneUI - Cute, Fluidic, top notch features covered by the Software of Samsung which is one of the leading mobile software in the universe.Camera - I still feel jaw dropped on the camera performance on the precision shots, deep zoom shots and ultra wide experience. This shows the maximum expertise of the R&D division of Samsung's excellence which none other manufacturer like Apple, OnePlus cant even reach near. Super flawless.Samsung S22 Ultra is an engineering, photography marvel of the universe and I would say this is one of the best decision to purchase Samsung S22 Ultra in my lifetime.. Proud to recommend for new buyers.

I have observed some display color density issues with written words as i scroll the pages.The words become thick and darker as you touch the screen ,becoming normal as you remove finger touch from phone.This is very irritating, giving headache.I have observed this thing for the first time in a Samsung flagship. There are no such issues with my Note 10 plus.I have seen this issue with some cheap phones,but for God sake this is the flagship from Samsung,with this price you expect nothing but perfection.I have put a return/replacement request,so some technician will visit and see my phone.I will let you all know the result of this inspection ,whether he tries to solve the problem or pushes me to accept the phone by accepting the inconvenience.Update 1-The technician was very cordial,listened to my complaints and made a report,on the basis of which my replacement request has been accepted.Great experience!I will update my star ratings again after i receive the replacement.Update 2- I received the replacement and it is working perfectly fine.My final review is here now.Amazon delivery and problem solving 5/5The Seller Appario retail 5/5Phone looks and display 10/5Performance 5/5Battery 4/5Camera 5/5I have updated my star ratings to 5/5 now.This phone is a thing of beauty!

The complete package

The S22 Ultra is easily the most powerful and versatile Android phone on the market right now.From the gorgeous crisp display to the ridiculously stunning camera & haptics, every small feature, is as good as it gets!Right off the bat, the build quality feels premium and I've been a fan of the minimalist camera cutouts from the start, even though it does gather some dust...Coming to the S-pen, originally I thought it would be a ""good to have"" gadget, which I'd forget about eventually, but BOY was I wrong...The ability to take notes is a nifty feature for sure, but it doesn't end there.... From air gestures to smart select to translate, its honestly insane how much this small tool can accomplish, and I haven't even scratched the surface of its capabilities.The performance from Snapdragon 8 gen 1 (rather than the Exynos) is unbeatable.I wasn't a fan of One UI in the past but I am surprised at how much they've managed to polish it up with One UI 4.Plus, if you want to customize your phone even further, make sure you install the Good Lock app by Samsung, it opens up a whole new world for the tinkerers like me :)The only gripe I have is with the battery. Its not the best out there, but considering the performance you're getting in return, its more than fair to cut it some slack.All in all, yes, its pricey. But, you get what you pay for, which in this case is an unrivalled beast of a premium flagship phone ;)

The phone is good but not the best. Battery life is average just getting 5hours screen on time even though I have kept the screen resolution to HD and power savings mode ""ON"".The main negative I found is heating issue, just by browsing, checking WhatsApp, Insta the phone is getting hot, that is so pathetic. Camera is good, zoom feature is ok, don't expert any DSLR clarity with it, to be honest I'm disappointed with the clarity, by seeing the reviews in youtube I expected a super crip image quality, Naaaa.. it's not there. I really dont agree with the NIGHTOGRAPHY of samsung, the phone at all performing well in the less light ambience, it create so much noise in the picture. And yeah, inspite that samsung says it has AI stuff, the picture comes blurry even with slightest movement of the subject.Display is good, it is bright and vivid and super smooth, no complaints with display at all.Sound is decent, keeping the Atmos mode on, really succeed in creating some surround effects.Spen is just take the phone into more productive level. This is one of the key feature I brought this expensive phone.From the past 8 years I'm only using Galaxy note series phone. Anyway the final statement is, Overall it is a good phone but I really don't think it's price worthy. Paid 1.12 lakh for the phone (including watch) it is really not justified this high price tag.Display, camera and sPen are the main catch of this phone, rest all are offered features are included even in phone below 30k price range (including 8Gen 1 chip set)To be honest, not that much satisfied with the phone!

A fantastic top tier Smartphone
","
I was in a dilemma before purchasing the S22 Ultra, whether to buy the samsung or to go for the iPhone 13 Pro. I was not a big fan of the Apple's walled Garden approach to their ecosystem and not a big fan of iOS either but during a short period of use i really liked the iPhone 13Pro. But i loved the Android, its flexibility and Samsungs extremely customizable One UI. So i took a leap of faith and pre-ordered the Ultra. And until now from the minute i unboxed this beast of a Phone (the charger situation aside), it never disappointed me. Perfomace is superb, cameras are outstanding, low light performance of the cameras are out of the world. Battery life is more than enough. One UI is beautiful , fluent and buttery smooth. Speakers are fantastic. I did not find any issue of overheating even after heavy sessions of gaming. But the phone gets a little warm. Thats all. Okay...! Now some of the Cons1. I am coming from a OnePlus 6, and when comparing with that phone, this one is heavy.2. Some pre-installed Samsung apps have all the permissions and notifications allowed which we cant change, uninstall or disable.3. When it comes to Video recording, Samsung still cant beat its Notched Rivals. They still outclass the Ultra by a huge margin.4. Another annoying thing. Long press of the power button wakes Bixby up by default. Although we can disable bixby, samsung wont allow us to set it to summon the Google assistant.If samsung keeps its promise of 4 years of major updates and 5 years of security patches for its top end phones, one can use this phone for more that 3 years easily if you have a habbit of holding on to a phone for that long. And i am Super satisfied with my decision to purchase this phone.

Very much a promising package and gives very less scope for disappointment. With this phone in hand, you will desire for less and aspire for doing more with this phone. Definitely will make other phone owners, except for iPhone 13 pro, feel envious.What I feel the best:1. Camera quality, potrait clarity, photography options, photo editing options etc2. Screen quality is outstanding and every image on the screen looks better than it's actual beauty. Very vivid and brishtl3. Haptics is so accurate and adaptive. Feel so good with so much attenction to detail for haptics.4. Strong built and premium Looks5. UI experience is smooth and fluidic, no breaks, no freezing, everything is ultra perfectNot to good:1. Battery - definitely has no enough juice to last move than a day with normal usage(no games or other powerful apps). For heavy users, it may last less than a day. I still feel it on par with other flagship phone (except iPhone) but definitely not a bang for your buck.2. I found it Hard to find a screenguard in market and had to shell out 1k to find a average screen guard.3. Not giving a PowerPoint adaptor. You need spend 1-2 K move for this.Rest all, it's a true flagship phone and a powerhouse in your hands...!

For anyone who wants the complete android experience, and does not mind shelling out a premium for the same, you can't get any better than this. The S22 Ultra is Samsung's answer to the ""Complete Flagship Package"". There maybe phones out there that excel in one area or another, but this mobile is so good at everything, it is hard to compare it to anything out there as a total package. The camera is other wordly, the display is beyond beautiful. Overall, I would highly suggest the S22 Ultra to anyone upgrading from a 3-4 year old device, looking for the complete, premium Android experience.

The best phone for photography...

I bought the Phantom Black 512 GB variant of S22 Ultra. I pre-booked the device along with the Watch 4 offer. My net cost after all discounts and offers for the combo was Rs. 1.14 lakhs.RATINGS: OVERALL 9/10Camera: 10/10 (the best photography on a smartphone; for videos however, iPhone 13 Pro would be best though).Software: 9/10Display: 10/10Battery: 8/10Charging speed: 8/10Sound and Haptics: 7/10Performance: 9/10Features: 9/10Call quality: 8/10Heating: 10/10 (didn't see any heating issue with my limited use so far; haven't played games yet)Ultrasonic Fingerprint Scanner: 10/10 (it is impressively fast and accurate)Face Unlock: 9/10 (it is superfast in well lit environments, but doesn't work in dark environments)Here's my review after 2 days of use:CONS1. This is a 2 handed phone. It is big and you'll be uncomfortable using it with one hand. I wish the phone was slightly narrower and came with a grippy sandstone case.2. No pre-installed screen protector. I don't think you'll find a perfectly fitting screen protector either due to the curved edges.3. Battery life is just okay. I get about 5 to 6 hours SOT on a full charge.4. Charging speed is just okay. I bought the Samsung 45W Travel adapter and it takes about 1.5 hours to fully charge the device. This is pretty slow compared to what we see with OnePlus/ Xiaomi/ Oppo/ Vivo phones.5. No charger or earphones in the box. Only the phone and a Charging cable (tpye C to type C) is provided.6. Phantom White in 512 GB is not available in India (only 256 GB is available). I wanted it, but had to settle with the Black option. Some reviewers say that the Black variant gets scratched easily for some reason, so keep that in mind.7. OneUI doesn't use Material You theme of Android 12 in it's full glory. Some people may like it, some would prefer the stock Android feel as seen on Pixel and Motorola devices. It's not bad though, but just not a refreshing change. So putting it in CONS section.8. Status bar icons are not too customizable.9. Curved Display: This has no practical use. They only look good on marketing materials. When you are actually using the phone, there is absolutely no benefit. On the contrary, content gets bent at the edges and not great especially when watching videos or photos.PROS1. The best camera on a smartphone for photography. For videos however, iPhone 13 Pro is best. I bought this phone primarily for 2 reasons: the cameras, and the S-Pen which comes with it's own housing.2. S-Pen: Only phone with the pen feature.3. The best Display on a smartphone. I have kept the default FHD+ resolution (120 Hz adaptive refresh rate) just because there is hardly any difference you'll notice between FHD+ and WQHD+ on a small screen, and also because there is hardly any content that is of such high resolution. So I switched back to the default setting to prolong battery life.4. Feature rich software: This has both plus and minus points. Minus because more and more features means more chance of bugs and device slowing down due to bloatware. It also consumes battery. On the positive side, you can do a lot of things, although much of it is fancy, non-essential stuff.5. One handed use option (software feature) is very nice.6. Switching between light and dark themes is very smooth along with adaptive pallette selection.7. Phone has built-in call recording feature (atleast in India) without the stupid voice announcement.8. Performance is very good. No heating issues or throttling so far.9. This is the first time that Samsung has brought the Snapdragon chip model to India. Based on reviews, it is better than the Exynos variant just as in previous years.10. Both Face Unlock and under display ultrasonic Fingerprint scanner are SUPERFAST. Although in dark environments, face unlock struggles to unlock the phone. Using the Fingerprint is better in dark environments.I got two cases: Spigen Thin Fit and Caseology Parallex (a Spigen sub-brand). They fit perfectly, without adding bulk to the device.I haven't found a screen protector yet that would fit perfectly without bubbles at the edges.So that sums up my experience with the phone over 2 days of use. Hope this helps you with your choice of smartphone.EDIT: I had pre-booked the device on the 5th of March and it was delivered to me on the 17th of March, even though deliveries began on the 12th itself. My complaint is w.r.t the fact that the exact same variant was available with 1 day delivery to my pincode starting from the 12th. So anyone who ordered between 11th to 15th would have received their delivery within a day, earlier than me. This is unfair because seller has to service orders on a first-come-first-served basis. I can't accept someone ordering upto 10 days after me to get his order before me.But I will keep this in mind next time I want to pre-book on Amazon. When I enquired about it, customer service told me that I got it at a discount. That's a terrible explanation because there was no indication of that when I pre-booked the device. The offline stores were offering pretty much the same deal. Had I gone with an offline purchase, i would have got it much earlier for the same price, plus I need not have worried about the product getting damaged during transit. I mean I can inspect the box and make a decision before purchase at an offline store. The box I received had a few minor damages, although everything inside was fine.Expect delays in deliveries if you pre-book an item on Amazon, even if the item is in stock and available for delivery to your pincode by the same seller.

Beyond expectations. A true flagship. Samsung has finally nailed it.
","
Pre-Ordered it on 3rd March 2022.Received it as promised on 11th March alongwith the Galaxy Watch 4, 44mm.Had been using the One Plus flagships since 2017.Initially , I was skeptical about Samsung devices due to the bloatware and other issues.However, I decided to take the leap to this device after much deliberation and narrowed doewn to the iPhone 13 pro max and S22 Ultra.I already have the Tab S7Fe and am very happy with the performance.Coming to the smartphone, the device received was the phantom black 12gb ram,256 gb variant.Amazing finish and build quality.I found it to be a bit heavy and bulky initially,  but after a while, got used to it.It is a large device and not advisable for people with small hands.I would like to break up my review in two parts.Pros and Cons.Pros:1. Amazing performance from the SD 8Gen1 chipset.No lags or glitches whatsoever. A true flagship with industry leading processing power. The RAM plus feature is good.2. Amazing battery life. - some people will complain about mediocre battery life. But I have had no issues so far. The battery needs to optimise the apps. And after about 1 week of use and 2 updates later, the battery performance has improved. Getting almost 2 days of battery life with the 120hz adaptive mode and QHD+ resolution always on.3. Stunning display.-Samsung has always been the unbeaten champion of display tech and has once again nailed it with this QHD+ display.The colour reproduction and accuracy is immaculate and precise. The superbright screen is easily readable in direct sunlight and no screen bleeding or inconsistent color observed.The adaptive brightness works flawlessly.4. Virtual RAM works wonders. The already adequate 12 gb of ram is complemented by the virtual ram feature and is a boon for multi tasking and gaming.5. S-Pen features. I have always been a die-hard fan of the S-pen and have craved to use a flagship device having the feature for my daily work and gaming use. The S-pen is very useful in jotting down notes,as a magnifier, as a doodle, as a selfie stick and adds to the convenience.6.Super versatile camera performance.The camera performance is absolutely spot on.Be it point and shoot, portrait mode ,selfie, video recording, pro-mode or the slow motion shooting,Bring it on. The versatility offered is unbelievable. Apple needs to upgrade from the 12 mp hardware and learn to deliver better hardware in lieu of tweaking the image post capture like Samsung. Details captured and the stunning portraits are proof of Samsung image processing with optimised hardware and software experience.7. Valie for money and bang for your buck.I pre ordered the S22 Ultra and the Galaxy Watch4, 44mm and got a very good deal on Amazon for ₹.1.08 lakhs.Had I opted for the apple ecosystem,  the total cost would have gone up to ₹.1.50 lakhs.The Galaxy ecosystem is evolving and the level of customisation is wat better than iOS ecosystem, although there is a huge scope of improvement.8. Samsung updates: I was concerned about the android updates as Samsung was notorious for non-updation of their old flagships. However, I was relieved to find out that Samsung has promised 4 years of updates. So that is a real peace of mind. And my device has already received 2 software ,firmware and security patch updates via OTA.Cons:1. One UI. The most irritating part is Non availability of Google voice assistant. Everytime I try to use the voice assistant,  the Bixby routine assistant is prompted. Samsung must go ahead and drop it's Bixby assistant which is not as optimised and versatile as Google assistant.2. Curved screen. In a way the screen is immaculate and accidental touches are avoided if we switch on the accidental touch option. But curved screens are a headache and prone to accidental touches. I so miss the flat screen on my One Plus 7T.3. App drawer horizontal navigation.The app drawer just cannot be modified to scroll vertically. I downloaded the good lock app and the home up drawer customisation is not up to the mark. Samsung needs to optimise this.4. The Galaxy app store needs to be synchronized with Google Play store so that unnecessary pop-ups and useless apps are not recommended.5. Heavy animations consume battery life and need to be disabled manually.6. Option of 4k video @30fps needs to be enabled manually.All said and done, I am fully satisfied with my purchase and I must thank Samsung for making this amazing device as a combination of the note and s series and also kudos to Amazon for facilitating my purchase.Thanks and regards.

I am not a gamer, use the phone for work. Still, the phone gets overheated. After capturing 2 pics, the phone gets overheated, I don't know what happens if I take 4K video for 5 mins.Performance is not good; after using one plus 6 for 3+ years, I strongly feel OnePlus 10 pro will be better performant than the 22 Ultra.The battery is terrible; it takes 90 mins on Samsung 45W charger and lasts only for one day with moderate usage.I brought this phone to use it for the next 3 years, but I am concerned about the performance, and durability as this becomes old. Should have opted for Iphone or 10 Pro

Excellent phone if you want a pen and a good camera!

IntroductionThe Samsung S22 Ultra is a Galaxy Note and as such, looks like a Note. In fact it's a more than perfect Note. It does everything a Note would do and even has a recessed pen! A Note person's wildest dream come true. In addition, unlike most Notes, this one has one of the best cameras you'll find in any flagship phone and great features.StylingWhile the looks... shape, proportions, colours etc are subjective, the edges are not pretty. Nor are the sharp corners. The edges could have been chrome or brushed steel. Instead, they are a glossy version of the colour, that looks painted and cheap. There is no camera bump, which some may like but it looks naked and cost effective to me. Also, the camera edges are dust traps. Once in a case, this looks more than fine but at that price, one could expect a better finish. The pen has been allowed to dictate the shape... curved sides and flat at the top and bottom. And the resultant sharp edges where they meet.PerformanceThe S22 Ultra is fast and smooth too, but It gets very hot with use. Not warm, hot! The S21 looks much better and doubles as a Note too. This one is not really a successor so the name is a mystery. Or is it just Samsung killing two birds with one stone?At it's core is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 which powers every 2022 flagship available in India right now. While it is fast, it does get hot with use which is not ideal, especially when you need to put it to your ear! Cooling this one is no small task and Samsung haven't managed to do it for sure. The case could keep your hand cool but the screen gets very hot too.The Camera is where it really scores over almost every other Android phone. It's better than all I've seen except the Pixel but it has a a wider ultrawide (slightly distorted) and macro focusing too. There's a pretty amazing sensor, a very powerful 10X Zoom lens and great camera software. The S22U tends to over sharpen images but this could be fixed later with the right software update yet it may not. The way it is now may be more popular, as at present, it's an excellent click and post. There is shadow noise but only if you zoom in.The Pen doubles as a remote shutter release (and can even control other camera functions like a magic wand!) which is very cool for Pros / tripod photos and selfies and group shots! I could take a selfie with the rear cameras by remote trigger! Likewise a group shot and not be limited to the selfie cam. It has a good range.ConclusionIf you want a premium Note with a pen, well look no further, this is as good as that gets. The recessed pen makes the display broader but that's absolutely fine... it even has it's advantages. The pixel pitch is imperceptibly less but 16:9 fills the screen better than the longer / wider format.The price obviously includes the pen which makes it more bearable. As of now, at their showrooms, Samsung are offering their Watch 4 (MRP ₹29K) at ₹3000 with the phone which is a great offer. If however, you don't need a watch, then it's expensive, at ₹105,000. If you can wait, when sales slow down, you will get it for ₹92K. (If you look hard enough, even now.) At ₹92K, it's a very good buy, it's features are cutting edge!The S22 Ultra is the best Note till date with an excellent camera to boot. If you like the looks, the shape and the metallic finish, just buy it already. It's fully worth the premium price. Never forget, Samsung are counting on the fact that the iPhone 13 Pro Max costs a lot more!_

This Smartphone  is everything you'll  ever need a great camera a great display great performance  and clean android experience.The one mark this missed is battery if you use this for performance  then expect below average battery.But if you use it normally it will last a whole day easily.Maybe a future update can fix this But buy this thinking that this would give less battery than most Smartphone  available.

Excellent build quality. Finally Samsung has outdone themselves. Snappy phone. The S pen makes so many things faster.

Hope my review will help many to take right decisions.I was a long term Samsung fan boy since Galaxy 1I have used Galaxy S2 , Galaxy S5 and then Galaxy S5 and I gave up on Samsung because of the SoC they used to ship in India which was very underperforming and overheating king - The Exynos SoCI switched to OnePlus but lately found OnePlus stopped caring and listening to it's community.I bought Apple iPhone 12 mini no doubt it was an amazing device but had very short lived battery which was expected but battery life worsened after 9 months of usage.I finally decided to check in to Samsung after looking at various reviews on YouTube I finally thought to give it a try and boy I must say it's worth it.Below are few highlights which I love the most.Camera : Hands down the best Camera. It captures immense details and has handful features.Portrait images are just breathtaking.Performance: Well this was the most concerning factor and boy oh boy what a relief the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 does an amazing job without a doubt and I've been testing this device since a week now and I've put it through a lot of high performance stage such as playing YouTube videos for 1-2 hrs followed by browsing on internet using Instagram and playing COD for 45 mins and I must say it did last easily 5-6  hrs SOT

Coming form Oneplus devices for the last 5 years, S22 ultra is truly a 5 star experience. Everything about this phone feels premium. There are so many settings and customization options that I am yet to discover them all. Plus I got the Watch-4 for almost nothing.....one extra star for that.Initially the phone will heat up a bit during charging and battery would seem like discharging within no time. Just give some time, let the phone learn your habits and suddenly everything will start falling in place.

The phone is a beast no questions asked. It worth the every penny you spend. Everything is above the scale:- fast, Snappy.Design is what stood out the most for me though its not much of a difference from it predeccssor still its feels out of the box to hold.Performance is as it should be, best in the game, With Snapdragon 8 gen 1 processor there is alot of a talk about heating however there is no such case with this phone. No matter how heavy user you are or how intense gaming you do this phone handles it all with a ease.Camera:- When i purchased this phone i was really looking forward to experience the camera it offers, If you compare this with best in market iphone 13 pro max, then you wont be disappointed, it offers similar camera quality or in some conditions even better. The dynamic range, saturation, portrait shots all are excellenet in day light. Its nightography function is also extremely good. Talking about video capabilities it offers 8k at 30fps and all other similar in market, its VDIS and OIS feature does make your video rich, steady with prefect light balance. Just like its predecssor this also offers superzoom 100x But all i can add is till 30x its perfectly good after that samsung needs to work on it. Perhaps in next 4-5 years we might be able to have 100x as clear as 30x zoom feature.S Pen:- latency has been reduced to 2.8s which is the super best i can say and also the air gestures is quite fun to use and you can do quite alot with your spen like signing your pdf document on your phone itself without worrying about to get a copy and then signing it.  Using S pen also gets the premium vibe to you in day to day uses it feels bossy.Battery life:- its Good can be better on day to day heavy uses it gets 7-8 hours of screen on time which i feel is already good but its competitor 13 pro max has much better battery compare to it. That generally offers 10 -11 hours of uses which is insane. I would ask samsung to focus on its battery this will generally lead to out perform even apple.Everything else is the best no competition design, performance, One UI, camera, S pen and display. This is phone of the year

Overall it's a great phone to have. Excellent screen and camera quality. Many of the camera categories it won Over iPhone 13 pro max. UI is clean . Finger print sensor fast but one in 10 times it will fail. Battery size is big but it's performance is not upto the mark. I kept all display settings high and I am using phone now more since it is a new one and I have to charge it morning once and evening once. It may come one full day with regular usage in future for me. That is not great for 5000 mah Battery but I can live with that considering how great the display is. And buy phone using without offer option only so you get it around 93k. With offer option is a joke. Just do the math you will know how silly with offer option is. Overall happy to have this phone.

Firstly, coming from iPhone, I found camera to be way too superior compared to iPhone.  Especially when it comes to zooming clicks.When it comes to ease of use, it's good overall. But OS smoothness is not that good compared to OnePlus's Oxygen OS. Apps download and installation takes a lot of time when compared to iPhone and OnePlus.There have been several events where I found apps close down automatically when you start using them. Maybe a software update might help on this. There have been events where the phone has lagged as well.Earlier I had OnePlus 7T Pro 2 years back and that phone was damn smooth and never did it lag at all not did any of the apps crashed u like Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.These were few instances where this phone has disappointed me quite a bit. All these issues can be resolved via software update. So hoping Samsung team might look into it and do the needful.Design is stunning and so is the S Pen.This phone has great aesthetics of how a super phone design should be. Now my mom uses my OnePlus 7T Pro phone and occasionally when I use it, it's too fast even being on Android 11. So, come on Samsung and fix the bugs. We have put so much of trust and money in this phone so we deserve the best experience from the phone of such a name.Rest, I will update my review after I get an OS update to see if the bugs are removed.Thanks!

Ultra phone at ultra price! Worth it though 👌🏻

I have been using the phone since 10+ days now, and it's been a fantastic experience. This is my first S series phone, that also comes with S-Pen so first Note series as well 😀.Performance:It's buttery smooth as expected from a flagship phone. RAM is pretty much occupied by system but I didn't found any issue while day to day use, and ain't a heavy user as well so can't comment about gaming performance.Battery: it doesn't feel like 5000 mah. Need to charge every morning, sometimes before sleeping at night. Hope Samsung fix it by software update.Camera:Tuning of camera is done very accurately by Samsung. Color levels, exposure, HDR..everything feels perfect. Zoom is extraordinary and perfectly usable till 30x-50x. Still haven't got opportunity for testing the camera in different environments, will update later for that.Accessories:I have applied Spigen screen protector on screen so fingerprint reader is working same as on naked screen, and S-Pen is also working fine I would say (Not smooth as on glass, but perfectly usable).Spigen Liquid Air cover is just perfect to hold the S22 ultra, as it provides extra grip on the sides.Even though it's costlier, I would recommend to buy who has budget for this ULTRA flagship. You will just love it!! 😍

Everything about this phone is excellent except the speaker volume and the finger print sensor when using a screen guard.

Okay, 3 Months user review is here. Lets go directly on the pros and cons.Pros -1. Ultimate curved beautiful design.2. Camera quality is unbeatable, beating iPhone here.3. S-Pen of course (The best feature however there is no much use of it, but good to have it)4. Software is good and smooth with many loaded features5. No Heating problem at all6. Unbeatable performance7. Jumbo battery with good backup8. Zoom - Ultimately Unbeatable zoom features (Upto 100x, just wow)9. Jumbo internal memory, no need to external memory card.10. 12 GB RAM is providing awesome experience.11. Latest powerfully processor12. Power sharing is one of the best features.13. Wireless charging is a cool feature. However it is not easy to handle. Cable charging option is better than this.14. Touch response is good.15. Better than iPhoneCons:1. Heavy design, you can not control it by one hand, could be better, sleek and light weight.2. Extra big screen, Samsung should provide such feature and design in small screen,  5-6 inches.3. Face reader - not beating iPhone, iPhone has super speedy and accurate face reader even in the night. So I am disappointed on this point.4. Horrible Finger print scanner - Too bad experience with it. Even oppo, vivo phone worth rs 20000 are having far far better finger print reading than this phone. So I decided to use pin lock only.5. No charger or earphones in the box, This is really a worst part of these costly phones. I hate it.6. I miss auto power off/on feature in this device. I love that feature to make the phone cool.7. If Samsung provide a date time, location and static text timestamp on the images captured by the camera, that would be a cool feature.8. Phone and features does not justify RS. 1,00,000 . Too much costly.Overall, this is a beautiful, Strong, Fast, Smooth, features loaded phone. I recommend it if you are fade up from iPhone. Not for general users. Business use mobile.Review after 2 Months -Cutting one star from the rating because it heats too much if you take many pictures and says its too hot you can not take more pictures. Then I had to put it in front of my car's ac vents to cool it for 15 minutes. So I missed valuable moment capture in that time by this phone. Luckily I was having iPhone too. And Samsung is claiming they put extras heating protection in it. It is not beating iPhone on that point. iPhone doesn't not heat even after heavy use.

It is everything we loved in a note, with the better camera system of the Galaxy series. Therefore is a great merger. I do not like the vibration motor, which is very soft and the camera shutter lag.

S22 Ultra 12gb 512gb is amazing, blazing fast. Camera has awesome clarity. Fingerprint sensor super fast. But all this kept aside this beast has a very weak heart. It has been given a very very bad battery.

One of the best smartphone to buy. Excellent display and mind blowing camera with fastest chip I.e. snapdragon 8 gen 1. S22 ultra is perfect from all ends and can go for buying it. Finger print reader is very fast, battery is also better giving 1 day life with moderate usage. Overall a very good phone to buy.

Whatever was written against this phone, I guess needs review by the same users after few days. Before buying this phone, I fixed my budget as 15,000 and because I do not play game, my choice was simple. I wanted a phone that can be used for online activities and photography. I read many reviews, watched technical reviews and slowly came to know about all the bad things about recent LG phones, like bad display, bad performance, bad processor, etc., so, I decided against LG W41. Then I found out, that only 6 months before same G35 helio mediatek processor was an essential item in many budget phones. So, I thought how much speed I need, I guess not much. So, I bought LG W41.  It is a beautiful looking, efficient and fantastic phone. It came home with 72% charge and with that I spend almost 36 hr without much loss. And for your information, it charges with optimized speed, first fast and then medium paced and last part slowly.  Yesterday, I had issue with incoming and outgoing calls (wi-fil was perfect), then I found even Samsung A50 had similar issue, then I followed videos online and fixed it very easily.  I have given 4 star, because it is not a complete phone. It does not have 4G-LTE (only 4G), or dual-SIM+SD option. I have one google pixel and one ipad pro. I know what it feels to own a superior device. From that experience I would like to tell potential users, do buy this phone. It is enough for all those normal activities we do in general. Whatever its specs, are more than enough for most of us.

LG mobiles are always have best UI.

Battery life is Awesome, it does not take me 6 Hours to charge as revewed by another customer - it too me less than an hour and half to charge from zero to 95%.

If you are kind of photography lover then this is not for you!But otherwise for this range it's a perfect buy!I bought it for 6800Rs with exchange of my old phone so for me it was fine for me!Mgf date: May 2021Box included charger, pin and transparent back cover

Good buy! 48mp camera is good. Comes with almost stock android experience but with a few pre-installed games.People who have complaints regarding the cameras specially selfie shooter are mostly used to the ""beauty cameras"" of chinese phones. This phone takes good selfies if the lighting conditions are right, close to natural, plus a lot of options to customise!Battery backup is great too, runs one and a half day easily. Only thing which could have been improved is a dedicated sim slot instead of a hybrid. All in all a great phone.

I had redmi 6 Pro and exchanged it for Redmi 11.But I'm not impressed with the phone.Display looks normal and I don't think its better than Redmi 6 pro. I still feel Redmi 6 pro screen is best.Camera is really a avg one. Not worth it.Prev Redmi phones were really good, camera quality too will be goodThis one doesn't fit in to Redmi family. Though it has good specifications, it doesn't worth.Fast charger is good, charges really fast.If you just need a phone you can go for this phone... more review after a week.Review after couple of weeks - March 8 2022.Display - Doesnt look like AMOLED display. For me its like a ordinary one.Battery: It charges really fast and it can withstand for a day.Use: I nvr did gaming on this phone. Just using for call & whatsapp. Sometime, screen flashes and some app crashes. Happens atleast once or twice a day. call quality is good. Though I've 6GB RAM, it nvr behaves it has 6GB of RAM.This phone can be used for ppl, who need a phone wiht big display and battery.camera is really bad. Don't know why Redmi is doing like this. Pictures looks normal outside with good sunlight. Under tubelight, could see more noises in picture. Not at all happy with camera.

 Hello all,Am new to redmi(note 11), yesterday I received new mobile and please find my observation at below.Am not a gaming user, am moderate user(daily usage) so i preferred Snapdragon 680 chip with 6nm architecture, but in the Redmi note 11 the chip is different Snapdragon 665 with 11 nm architecture.So please be awareness. The issue in company level not Amazon.So Am returning the same mobile.For your reference I have attached screen recorded, please find the same.Note: They have mentioned in the box, mobile(about option) as snapdragon ""680"" But they used 665 chipset instead of 680.Simply waste of money for 15k budget please go for other branding mobile.Thanks.

I had redmi 6 Pro and exchanged it for Redmi 11.But I'm not impressed with the phone.Display looks normal and I don't think its better than Redmi 6 pro. I still feel Redmi 6 pro screen is best.Camera is really a avg one. Not worth it.Prev Redmi phones were really good, camera quality too will be goodThis one doesn't fit in to Redmi family. Though it has good specifications, it doesn't worth.Fast charger is good, charges really fast.If you just need a phone you can go for this phone... more review after a week.Review after couple of weeks - March 8 2022.Display - Doesnt look like AMOLED display. For me its like a ordinary one.Battery: It charges really fast and it can withstand for a day.Use: I nvr did gaming on this phone. Just using for call & whatsapp. Sometime, screen flashes and some app crashes. Happens atleast once or twice a day. call quality is good. Though I've 6GB RAM, it nvr behaves it has 6GB of RAM.This phone can be used for ppl, who need a phone wiht big display and battery.camera is really bad. Don't know why Redmi is doing like this. Pictures looks normal outside with good sunlight. Under tubelight, could see more noises in picture. Not at all happy with camera.

Good for daily tasks
","
Bought this phone since my old phone was giving me network related troubles and also the processor was not powerful enough to handle latest apps. This phone is excellent to do regular tasks like social media apps, browsing, youtube, online study etc. Processor is capable enough to handle normal tasks related to our day to day affairs.It has UFS 2.2 storage feature which makes app opening snappier. Initially I wanted to go with Moto G31 but this phone easily beats G31 in value for money department. My only concern with this phone was the ads/crapware in MiUi but surprisingly Xiaomi has manage to reduce it a lot and if you carefully disable the relevant options within the MiUi, you will not get any ads.Regarding Camera, it has average camera quality. Nothing impressive but this was expected in the price range and I'm ok with it cause I'm not a selfie shooter. I have my own DSLR which I use for any special kind of photography. Video is not that great. Its OK for one time viewing or for sharing on social media.Processor is OK. It can handle most regular daily tasks without any issues. Occasional hiccups are expected but they are understandable in terms of price-performance ratio. What surprised me is that my Mom's Redmi Note 5 has Snapdragon 625 processor which has 4K video recording but this one doesn't despite it being superior to 625 processor. It would be great if Xiaomi can enable at least 1080p/60fps in the next update.Phone has all the important sensors like gyroscope, compass etc. Many times in this prices range, gyro or compass sensor is absent which are important sensors. I use Google maps a lot for navigation so Compass comes handy to know my direction.Screen is excellent. Its on Par with 20-25K phone range. 90hz is smooth. Sunlight visibility in outdoor is great. My old phone had IPS panel which was excellent but sunlight visibility was very poor. This is just brilliant. Content watching is immersive. Also its not too big either like 6.7 inches phone which are cumbersome to carry in pants. This one is sleek looking.Battery is above average tbh. Xiaomi needs to do better optimization in this phone. Though it has 5000mah battery but optimization is poor which eats away battery even while doing normal tasks. It can survive the whole day but Xiaomi needs to think about it in the battery department. 33w fast charger is game changer. It charges phone fairly quickly. So, that balances out the optimization issue to a bit. Kudos to Xiaomi for providing ""real fast charger"" instead of supplying 15w charger and calling it ""Fast charger"".Water/Dust resistance is essential.It has Dedicated slot for SD card which is also a plus point which going for this phone. Other phones in this category have hybrid solutions or no expansion slot.Side Mounted physical fingerprint sensor works great. This is what I prefer instead of in-display optical finger print scanners.Carrier Aggregation is there. Dual 4G standby works great. I can use Vodafone 4G while JIO sim stays active. Call quality is great. Dual Speakers provide adequate loudness and speaker quality are excellent.Overall this phone serves my needs. You can weigh your requirements with pros/cons and decide it. There won't be a perfect phone in this price range but this one ticked all my requirements. Thank you Xiaomi. You sure know how to make affordable and value for money smartphones for Indian consumers.

I was using redmi note 5 and now upgraded to this phone.It's AMOLED display is awesome😍😍😍. Its the best thing in this phone.. And also good battery backup. 20-24 hrs with moderate use..Starburst white colour is superb😍😍😍. I loved it.Decent Rear camera U will love it.Front camera is ok better than redmi note 5 but not compare this with 20k or 30k phone cameras. Video quality is average.At this price it is good.Good performance. No lag issues. 90Hz refresh rate is nice. Finger print sensor is working fine.Bright Torch light. Light weight.. Easy to use in one hand.. Comfortable design. First  day I experience a delay in charging and I thought it doesn't have fast charging at all. And also there was huge heat issue during charging.Second day that problem is almost solved.. Heating problem reduced and charging also become faster.. And  4th day onwards normal heat issue only and charging become faster.Auto call recording is not there.

Redmi Note 11 review :: Camera Quality is not upto the Mark.
","
Advantages::* UI Display looks good.Disadvantages::* Mainly camera/video quality is not satisfied. company informed 50MP.. but pixel clarity less than 16MP.. The reason is 50MP is not default in camera view.  everytime, we have to select 50MP option.. Also no zoom option for 50MP view.. Completely unworthy cameras compare to samsung/Realme(sony camera).* When Playing game also phone got hanged frequently...* Morning you charged in , end of the day is getting completely drained..* 2 speakers sounds are little lower than other phones..* Too many advertisements.. its keep on advertising on every navigations..so, its budget phones.. targetting all middle peoples with Ads. so MI company will get more beneficial from you,. AND YOU WILL NOT BE GETTING BENEFICIAL., YOU WILL BE SEEING SO MANY ADS LIKE YOUTUBE,.Before buying, Think twice.. if you need Good quality camera/video phones, just Blindly go for Other brands like Samsung/Realme & lQOO..If you don't bother camera quality, focusing on good display & surfing YouTube & browser, you can opt this..

Though writing a review only using it for 4 days is too early, but there are few things need to be shared:Display: Excellent Display. Build quality is also good.Battery & Charging: Good battery life (24 to 36 hrs in moderate usage) & fast charging.Audio: Decent audio quality with dual speakersCamera: Good camera in daylight conditions, images are sharp & detailed... though under low light it's a bit grainy but still detailed (again other mobiles in this range also has similar problems, their softwares in order to lose the grains makes the picture soft)Video: Video is not upto the mark. It's very shaky. Must have some issues with the stabilizer.Gaming: Gaming with high graphics & for long hours is not recommended. Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 is not a heavy gaming processor(However I was playing SFA for 2-3 hours with low graphics quality & its performing fine)Heating: Till date no heating issues.

Redmi phones quality is going down with each updated model. E.g. my Note 8 has much better camera quality than my new Note 11.Further the speakers at full volume may permanently damage them (again low quality).Perhaps this is going to be my last Redmi product as I will switch to a better quality brand after 3 years (once Redmi permanently makes my phone non operational through software upgrades as it happened in two previous phones 3S Prime and Note 7).

Just don't buy it.I will update my review if any changes are observed in future.Comparing this to my 2 years old realme x2Pros - The only pro is dual speakersCons:-1. Build is inferior to realme x2.2. YouTube only supports 1080 while my earlier device supported 2160.3. Audio codec support on bluetooth ji device is SBC while my previous device supported AAC.4. Earpiece audio quality is not good too.5. Camera quality in front as well as back is not as good as my previous device.It felt like a downgrade from my previous device which had the same price and better processorI was hoping it to be having a good build like Redmi note 10 unfortunately it doesn't, currently very disappointed from Mi.There is not a option to return this product, only damaged products can be returned so I am stuck with it. Amazon should show a pop up regarding such important matters and should not hide it in some corner.Was a satisfied prime user until now but now I am questioning my choices.

Performance gets sluggish after taking calls(normal call, whatsapp call) due to CPU throttling.I have even observed CPU frequency getting stuck at 690Mhz and never coming up (Enable Developer options -> Power monitor -> Monitor Frame rate)This is a SERIOUS bug and root cause of all performance issues being faced by multiple users of RedmiNote11. In fact I am reviewing my 2nd unit after exchanging 1st unit due to performance issues.Check the attached pic how Geekbench scores vary based on which time benchmark was taken.Before the call, all good scores above 380. Post taking calls, it become 170!

1. You can't enable an Always-on display for the whole time. It will be shown only after 10 sec you turn off the screen2. Notification Sound setting is not available I can't believe you can't turn off notification sound separately in 2022 this feature is available in 2015 smartphones it is combined with ringtone sound you have to silent your whole phone If You don't want notification sound definitely Then you are going to miss the calls then because vibration is not strong during ringing but in other cases typing taping vibration fell very strong3. Focus mode is a joke In this phone you will still get notification from focus mode itself if someone Texted you on WhatsApp or any other app send you a notification it will not show from which app it's coming but it's still annoying What the point of focus mode if I am getting notification from focus mode itself4. BIG PRIVACY ISSUE - there is an app called security app I don't know why smartphones need this kind of app in 2022 what's the point of a smartphone anyway this app takes your all permission all means all location, camera, call logs, file & storage everything but you can't disable it and can't uninstall it

Worst Phone ever. 😞

Bought this phone at 16k and wasted my Money.1. Camera:Front camera is worst camera ever in any phone under even 10k  13MP Camera looks like 1.3MP VGA camera that comes in 1k Feature Chinese phones while video calls even if you use Fiber 100mbps or 1gbps connection.Back camera is 50MP but in Indoor it's like old 5MP in Only work good in Sunlight and outdoor good lighting conditions otherwise don't expect much it's badest 50MP camera.Max resolution for video recording is only 1080p 30fps ..... old Realme 6 can record 1080p 60fps 4k 30fps  and compare the price of both. This Redmi Note 11 Even doesn't support 1080p 60fps Only 30fps is max option in this why it have an new processor if old one is powerful. This phone is completely Downgrade on any phone you currently have right now. Even from 2017 ....2. Performance:  As per the specs on paper it mentioned SD 680 in it and it's poor processor and even MediaTek G85 works better than this shit.It take longer time to capture and preview picture in galley after we take a photo in camera. And phone even didn't support Some apps properly Like vidmate kinemaster and few other apps it just automatically close apps after sometime while using and kinemaster just open only 1st time 2nd it start crashing and that was not app issue it's phone issue itself.3. Software:  Only one thing i want to say is Now i figured out why it called a MeMe Ui ........Lags a lot. Hangs like 10 years old phone.4. Display: Yeah Good but 60hz looks like 30hz and 90hz looks like 60hz so No reason to spend Money for 90hz screen .....  Buy any other good phone with 60hz it will be lot better than this 90hz .....5. Battery:I haven't used phone much because of these issues so i wanted to Return and Get Refund buy amazon Rejected .....  Battery maybe a good in this phone but for how ""long""So, My opinion on this phone is if you get it under 10k than ok but if you you can use it  with those issues i have mentined above otherwise not worth to buy...""Say No To This Phone"" Don't waste Your Money on This Device it will not work properly. And can't satisfy and Normal User.For camera Users Don't buy it .... If you use camera in Low Light conditions than Don't waste your money on this phone better to buy Any other phone but not This.Do Not Buy this 👎

There are too many bugs and glitches in this device. It lags every now and then. There have been two system updates sience i bought this device and none of them fixed the problem. Dialer is one of the biggest problems because every time i open the dialer there is at least 3 sec. Lag. Its very frustating. Camera quality is not very good. And heating problem is also there. So if yoh are are a very light user (you dont use too many apps) and dont click too many picture and you don't get frustated by 3 sec lag of dialer ever single time you want to call somebody then you can go for it.

Must have
","
I purchased it for my father. It's great, working smoothly and what else would we need. I mean it's a normal phone with better display and carrier aggregation. However, let's not set the expectations so high. If you are buying the phone for camera, you can go for high end Samsung, Apple or even OnePlus device that will cost you 40k + for a decent phone from those companies. But buying this phone and complaining that camera is not on par with DSLR is something hilarious. For my father, it's a great phone. Display is the primary highlight.

Not much better than note 10 last year.

It is an average performance device and at some part it performs below average.Pros:-Dual speakers.-90 hz Amoled display-50mp camera- miui 13 (android 11) out of the box.- 1gb more memory extension in 4gb ram device- quite light phone.- battery Is best.Cons :- Processor : it makes the phone perform similar to redmi cheaper ₹7000-₹9000 phones.- Display : Avg quality amoled display although the brightness is very good it does not feel as crisp as my note 10 pro also you can't play HDR videos on it and no 4k video support.- Audio : no Dolby Atmos support and those who use note 10 pro knows how much it affects the sound (i.e. takes it from avg to good quality loudspeaker experience)- Camera : it says 50mp and shots do come out quite good but that is during sufficient lighting only and image quality takes a huge toll in slightly poor lighting conditions.I bought it for my mother and for her the YouTube Facebook and Instagram work fine audio is sufficiently loud.Also remember to buy the insurance at least for screen damage as it is amoled display and could cost you high during repairs.

RN 11 is a good phone at 12499, the display is superb. Battery backup is very good thanks to 6nm processor. The speakers are clear and loud.The biggest letdown were cameras, the sensor produces average pics in daylight. It doesn't support 60fps , or EIS . Also the device doesn't feel snappy, it stutters while switching to apps .Conclusion - Good phone if you are content consumer , don't even consider this if camera & gaming are your 1st priorities.

This is my 6th phone from MI/Redmi Series.I have seen many phones before buying this. Finally selected this one bcz it meets all that I wanted.1. I need an IR blaster. (other than MI phones I did not find this great feature)2. Audio/Video for calls and its quality/call recording (Excellent)3. Smooth/bright/sunlight/outdoor display (Excellent)4. Dual Speaker (top and bottom) and sound clarity is one of the best ( Excellent)5. 6GB/128GB + 33W charger + 90hrz ( best  in this price range)6. Comfort in hand and also in the pocket.+ The camera quality is enough for me, satisfied with this price range.+ I charge once and use it all day. A one-time charge is enough for a FULL DAY..+ No heating problem.Got everything I need and gave it 5 stars, totally satisfied.It seems MI knows what Indians want, coming up with good low budget phones and trying to giveas best possible features are possible in that price range.Huff...never understand how someone buys an Apple phone for 70,000+ rupees or even more.TIP: We should not use an always-on display and animations and a high refresh rate to keep the batteryhealthy for all day.Amazon delivered in 6hr. and got a 1000 rupees discount with CC. Completely satisfied. Thank you.

The 6Gb Ram version is quick and works well on daily tasks, Ram management is good, the only flaws I saw is a boatload of junk per installed in the phone and Wi-Fi seems to be a bit weak as it keeps disconnecting frequently on moving around. But works well on 2.4 ghz. I Bought this for my mother and it works pretty well and 90hz screen refresh rate is also amazing,auto brightness although does not work really well specifically in dark mode the brightness becomes too low.Update: Wi-Fi issue Still Persists even after changing all the suggested option.

Not that great! Fingerprint sensor on the right side of the phone is the biggest disappointment out of all! Just a light touch will open it plus the location of the sensor is the most common place to touch. Secondly, the notifications are completely useless I can never pickup a call on time because it keeps on disappearing whenever I try to click, same goes for reminders and alarms. Also, the back of the phone gets easily scratched. If you're buying it on budget then it's okay but if you want a good smartphone with great technology this phone is not it!

Pros1)Amoled Display, Great for multimedia watching.2) Supports Carrier Aggregation i.e 4G+ singals3) IP 53 Rating.. no worries of phone damage due to rain, splash of water.4) Stereo speakers are loud and clear, no distortion even at highest volume. Balance between speakers is off but still considering price no complaints5) Widevine L1 certified, Can watch Full HD Content on streaming services6) Future Android Updates to Android 12 and 13, security updates till Jan 20257) IR Blaster.. Use phone to control electronic appliances such as TV, DTH Set top Box, ACs etc8) UFS 2.2 storage.. much faster than eMMC storage used by many mid range devices.9) Excellent battery life, easily lasts whole day and two days if usage is light10) 33 watt fast charging, charges phone in 1 hour 15 minutes.11) Brightness is good even under direct sunlight.12) No heating issues, some phones get warm even during calls.13) It supports Alexa Hands free.. really useful while driving.14) Fingerprint reader, Face unlock works well15) No issues in call qualityCons.Cons are mostly software based and can be fixed via update.1) Auto Brightness issue.Phone brightness increase automatically under sunlight but in darker situations the brightness stays low andi have to manually increase brightness.2) I Have 6 GB ram model and even then some background apps are closed by the system.3) Always on display feature is only for 10 seconds.4) Cameras are average (OK for basic use)// I do not game on phones so can't comment on gaming performance. In regular use phone is fast// For Ads free experience watch youtube videos ( I have not seen single ad on my device till now)// For people living in metro cities consider buying 5g phone. Rural areas can buy this one as 5g will take some timeVerdict:- Best all rounder phone in budget with minor software bugs which i expect to be resolved considering this phone will get android 12 and 13..

This is a good phone at 13k and better than Samsung phones under 20k.Camera is quite good. The uwa camera is 8 mp which is decent. Added photos of uwa,wa and 2x zoom. Clearly better than previous Samsung M21 I had. And does not kill the images by oversharpening like Samsung did.Pro mode allows full control. camera2api fully supported (level 3). Overall 5/5 for cam.Calling and network seems ok. SAR 0.85 which is better than many other phonesAudio 5/5 - has stereo speakers with some bass and quite loud, 3.5mm jack and sound through headphones is excellent.Battery lasts more than 2 days for me as I only do calls, use camera sometimes and listen to music. The 5000 mah battery somehow lasts longer than the 6000 one in Samsung.Comes with all sensors and fm radio.MIUI 13 - liking it so far. Coming from one ui 3.1 and stock Android before that, my opinion is that they were clean and simple but lack some useful features. MIUI is more customizable and useful.No heating or lagging issues so far but I dont play games, so cant comment on that.Overall complete package with 33w charger and back silicon case screen protector, unlike recent Samsung phones which removed charger and put a usb c to usb c cable so that some people are still forced to buy chargers.Also no 5G which is good for price reduction. By the time 5G gets available properly the prices will reduce.

Average!

I didn't like it! I had used redmi note 8 pro previously, so It's display got damaged and I bought this, this is not good, made for people like our parents and grandparents! It doesn't support HDR videos playback, no 60fps recording at 1080p, the camera has good focus control in video recording but lot of frame drops at high quality and over sharpening! The camera captures true to life colours in well lit conditions but very soft image looks blurry and not at all close to sharp..! Single flash, 90hz doesn't make much difference It's still useless! Phone feels stuttering! No ram management! No split screen, no good gaming! Good stereo speakers available, super tight headphone jack (you may end up damaging your earphones), the camera is like samsung camera, it's very white, cartoonish, blunt images (need stable hands), the pro mode had lots of settings, ulta wide is bad, macro is super ultra garbage useless!!!, Front is not good at all just for name sake it's there, good case and in hand feel, super slow unlocks with biometrics, fast charging is good, enhanced cooling doesn't work heating issues observable, battery backup not good, for so much efficiency, the battery backup is very poor, the phone is very useless and not value for money, it has more cons than pros!After a month of use! I even thought of testing it with an actual samsung phone.. in that case I had my dad's Samsung galaxy j6 4gb varient. I was shook!!! The 6 year old much smaller device performed better! Although it had a bit higher saturation... But it produced better contrast for almost everytime against redmi note 11 and also the biggest shocking result was the difference between human faces! The redmi's output was blunt and soft and even everywhere while an American face looked completely wheatish - white on the redmi, the same face on Samsung had more details about the pale spots on the face, the redness, the pink, (the overall contrast on the image display was so much impressive on Samsung! Even though redmi uses a samsung panel, the GPU on this phone is garbage!!!Do not consider!!!

Good points:1. Screen is good quality with 90hz refresh rate.2. Dual speaker set is good for multimedia and phone calls3. Battery life is good for calls and browsing4. Charging is really fast5. Build quality is really good. Weight is not much. So good to carry around6. Lots of themes and fonts and customisationBad points:1. Processor is not good for any types of games. Even very old processor do better than this1.5. Cpu and Ram are not good. Phone is slow to react. For e.g. when opening phone book after a while, gets stuck and takes time to refresh. Same with all apps.2. All camera are very poor quality3. Too much google bloatware. Google trying to take over your life4. Security issues.  IPhone and samsung are way better5. Redmi not giving Android 12 which has come on even budget phones nowOverall, can buy if browsing, phone and casual video calling are main uses. A BIG NO for camera and games purpose.

Not too many but surely mora than 10.IMPORTANT: - If you are using Stock Android or near Stock Android, then dont buy this phone - If you take Selfie or photo/video and need good quality don't buy - I got carried away with camera specification andsome pics uploaded here. - Decide wisely, there is no way back for next 2/3 years once purchased :-)I am not happy with this purchase FYI (For Your Information).

According to my usage pattern, I'm not a gamer. This is so far my experience with this handset:Pros:1. Everyday tasks run smooth since it support 90HZ refresh rate.2. The AMOLED looks good not the best color accuracy though.3. Great battery life. 33W charger charges the phone in 1-1.15 hrs.4. 6nm SD 680 Processor dissipates less heat.5. Less weight + Small screen size = Great in hand feel.6. Good haptics. Stereo speakers (Incorrectly balanced).7. Great custom rom support if you hate MIUI.Cons:1. Below average cameras (Front+back).2. Lags and jitters in the UI.3. Ads everywhere (Enabled by default). Lots of bloatware (Can be uninstalled).4. Poor software update cycle.5. Underperforms in gaming (PUBG+COD).6. Occasional proximity sensor issues.7. Adaptive brightness is very bad.Overall a good device for the price I got. But definitely not reliable for long term use unless you can flash custom ROMs..

Device is pretty good considering the price. There are lot of good features like 90hz amoled screen, which is awesome, 5000mAh battery with 33w charger, premium look. Processor is good for daily uses. It's not for gamers. It's overall a good phone but the camera is pathetic. The imageycomes grainy. It could be a bit better considering the price. Don't know if they'll fix it with update or not.Verdict: If you're a casual user and your media consumption is high and can compromise with camera then you can definitely go with it.

After 3 days use .. i think my old Samsung mobile is better than this...Problems :1. Major problem is at incoming call.. screen wont switch off even if power button is pressed.All mobiles i have used screen will turn off as soon as power button is pressed if we dont want to take incomming call...but this mobile screen will be always on and it will accidentally accept the incoming call if its inside pocket ... very bad ..2. Camera quality is bad..and  50mp camera is not recognized by apps like doc scanner apps it will be only activated inside stock camera app..And doc scanner apps only see 8mp camera as primary scanner to take photos..very bad...3. Heating issues .. i thought that being snapdragon chip heating will be negligible ..but we can feel the heat .. same as samsung mobiles ..4. This mobile is using AI proximity sensor..it like a virtual device ..real hardware is not present..may be this is causing incomming call screen problem...i am switching back to my old mobile and wait for some updates before using it .. very bad..Redmi is releasing mobiles without proper testing..

The phone is good (I've 6+64 Black one). MI has increased the power efficiency, display quality, and camera from the older version keeping in mind the way it'd do wonders for business work although as expected the processor is on a downside.It'd have been awesome if a glass back was there and sd695 would've been fitted but 14.5k is a fair price for the released product no doubt but upgrading it from RN4 was a big loss for me personally.Issues:1. The left speaker (on the top) is producing a lower sound as compared to the right one (below). Balancing it in the setting would do the job but please update it in the next software upgrade.2. GPS location is not getting accurate. It's about 200m-1000m inaccurate. (Thinking about replacing it).

I'm writing this review after one month of usage. Got it at sale for 13k.Pros:- Good 90hz Amoled screen at this price. One the cheapest Amoled phone.Well that's it.Cons:- Terrible camera. (Yes, I know I can't expect a pro like camera at this price point) but both the the cameras are literal piece of trash. They pixelate the videos. Photo quality is below 7-8k price phones. My 2016 budget Lenovo phone (14k) clicks 10 times better photos and 20 times better selfie. And 100 times better videos. (No exaggeration). If you are going to buy it, then buy it thinking it's a camera-less phone.Other details:- Virtual RAM is mentioned 2gb on 6gb ram phone but I got only 1gb VRAM.Loaded with bloatware. But it's acceptable as it's a budget phone. Weight is pretty heavy. Processor is not that good but considering the price point. It's okay.

After using it for  more than 1 month-Camera: I installed Gcam and it captured very well details and colors. Really Gcam does a miracle. You will also get 60fps video recording option in Gcam.  And it also improves video stabilization. Videos comes good in day light.Performance: I am not a heavy gamer. So it's very good for daily tasks and doesn't hang often.Battery: It's a boss. I get more than 12 hrs of backup instead of heavy usage. I watch videos, use social media and for study purpose. And the charger is really fast it will charge 90 % in 50 minutes. After that it will take 15 -20 min for remaining 10 % charging. But it sometimes charges slowly. I think it's a software issue.FingerPrint: I didn't like it. It is slow and sometimes doesn't unlock ur phone.Speaker: Best in this price range. loud , n crisp sound.Display: you will love the colors while watching movies.Pros: 3 card slot, iR blaster, dual speakers, 90hz amoled display.Cons: no notification light, sometimes slow charging speed, night videos shots not good.

Also, the AI option is not available with the front camera.I was excited about the Alex app integration, but it always gets stuck and needs re-install/re-register to make it work.The battery lasts for 12 hours, if you keep it on standby, else it won't.  33W charger is good.The display and dual speaker are okay, but not a wow experience.Even with a 6GB RAM, I don't see any performance difference.

And best phone for medium usage in this range and segment😊.

Worst ever mobile in my life don't buy it
","
There are many obligations facing with my mobile after the use of 15days,Camera quality is worst first thing,doesn't charge at all,it's taking 8hrs to get charging,Now I'm trying to sell it off but no resale value they are asking for 10000.Worst processors,Its hanging up already, with a phone call and doesn't work as my activities, it works as it needs. Keypad is worst not working properly,  please don't buy MI or real me Xiaomi phones in life , I need a replacement but not able to do it, as it has been passed of a month. Really worst mobiles from these bad companies.I'm selling my phone now itself, There is no response from Redmi if i contacted them also , Please consider this , i lost 4000 in a 15days buy buying this worst mobile ever , I think i had a bad luck to get this type of defective piece .

Pros1. Amoled Display with 90Hz Refresh Rate which is quite good.2. Z-Axis Linear Vibration Motor.3. Stereo speakers.4. Good battery Backup with fast charging support.Cons1. 4K videos can be played in Redmi note 4 but Redmi note 11 doesn't support 4K Vidoes.2. Not support LDAC and AAC Audio Codes, but only SBC Codes.3. Noticed that some colors are unbalanced and much saturated while playing videos, and it looks pathetic.4. Average Cameras both Rear and Front, but at this price range, can't expect more.

A product which gave issues rather than features
","
The first week usage was quite normal and there was not a single hint of problems. But with time, I started to notice some bugs which I thought was caused by software issues and could be fixed through an minor update. As days passed the issues got bad such as Delayed call notification,disappearance of call logs,and worst of all sudden blinking of display (""On-Off issue"") that stays for 15-20 minutes whenever happens.Even the quality of the camera doesn't stand upto the mark as the videos I capture seems to contain lots of noise and grains. Also the Ram management and the refresh rate is not quite perfect, it looks like the features were just part of the overhyped marketing and was not actually put in the device as I use it in my everyday life. Therefore I am really disappointed with this device performance and totally irritated by the issues that keeps accelerating as time passes.

Review after 10days of usage: I am really disappointed with the camera quality. The primary camera is good under sunlight but the rest are useless.Charging is really fast. The size of the phone makes it easy to grasp. For a person who doesn't play games, the phone is somewhat ok. The phone seems to have a tendency to heat up during video calls.

Mobile manufacturers are clearing stocks, Need to inform 5G mobile support 4G band but all 4G mobile will not support 5G.Take example, if you purchase 20,0000 mobile today, after 20 months you may need to change to 5G mobile hence it will cost you 1000 per month (costing matters) and you will not get High exchange value (not even 50% cost), Currently 5G yet to come in India, may be yearend or come will be high cost.Points to Remember while purchasing Mobile:1) Mobile band support, Dual Wi-fi Support is better.2) Graphics PPI matter hence check PPI value of mobile. It directly related to Mobile display and colour quality, Higher is better.3) Check Mobile camera F value (lower value, higher picture quality) if less than 1.8 is best. Mostly camera quality depends on Focal Value not on pixel4) Android upgrade support. This is important as your mobile will useless within 2 years, remember you don’t want any mobile who cannot upgrade to Android 11.5) Item Weight and height of mobile. Lower is better, it really matter as you will get pain while holding mobile for long time, specially  old people.6) Mobile resolution, Higher is better7) screen refresh rate, Higher is better8) Clean Android installation. This is also important as manufacturers cannot force you to install or retain any app.M12 /Pro6000 battery (not fully tested yet)Android 11, v11.0 operating system, One UI 3.1with 8nm Power Efficient Exynos850 (Octa Core 2.0GHz)90Hz screen refresh rateSamsung Brand (Non-Chinese)Galaxy Store supportDolby Atmos support.

Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn’t give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you’re choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you’ll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review

UI is great and snappy. Lots of customization options.6. The display is good and smooth with 90hz refresh rate. It does make the difference.7. Fast charging works fine.Cons:1. The weight of the phone is on the heavier side @ 220 gms2. The display could have been a full HD+ @ 1080p3. No led notification light. All though there are apps that can do the job on an AMOLED screen.Overall, a good package.

This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information.

Amazon hid all reviews for first few days till most of the stocks are sold out. Then after that it is not allowing to write negative reviews.

(Subjective)▪︎Amazing battery life. I am getting more than 24hrs of usage after fully charged.CONS▪︎Worst camera ever. True 48MP is all bulls**t. Low light pics are also worst.Front camera is also not good.▪︎Seriously??? No Slowmotion, Timelapse & other basic features in camera.▪︎It doesn't support Camera2Api which means I cannot download GCam.▪︎Worst Screen resolution. While everyone is giving Super Amoled display & Full HD display, what happened to you Samsung??▪︎90Hz refresh rate is just gimmick.▪︎8nm processor is also waste.▪︎While all others are giving Snapdragon processors, Samsung is stuck with its Exynos which is basically useless. Phone is hanging sometimes.▪︎Phone is a bit heavy and you'll have a hard time with its weight. It's like holding a powerbank.▪︎15Watt charger?? Samsung...upgrade bro.▪︎Wifi only supports 2.5GHz band and no 5.0 GHz bandFinally dont get decieved by True 48MP, 8nm processor, 90Hz refresh rate and other gimmicks. You will be disappointed. I am very much disappointed. The worst thing is there is no return option in Amazon. Amazon bro...you too planned everything so well. Good job.

The display is the worst anyone could get at this price point.The processor is reasonably slow. Face detection is a joke. Battery is 6000 mah but will take forever to charge. But the side fingerprint sensor was good .Camera was okayish. Add a few more bucks and buy a better phone with OLED display.

Pathetic customer support
","
I bought the phone for my mother. Her usage is limited to making calls, the phone stays idle all the while. She had one more requirement that I shouldn't have to recharge it regularly. Hence choose this 6000 mAh battery phone. I was happy first few days, it gave 4+ day battery life but then an update came and spoilt everything. In 12 hours it would discharge completely. I approached the customer care and the customer care took remote access and checked logs and said, I see everything healthy in device. I told even though your log shows everything right, that doesn't translate to what I physically see. I probably had conversation for almost 10-15 mins but he was always coming to point he is not seeing problem. This was my first experience with samsung phone and this will be the last. And reason is not because product was bad but the customer support is pathetic. If I get into this kind of situation with their other products as well within a week or few weeks, I would simply waste my money. I am feeling lucky that I did not buy any of their exorbitant product and learnt the lesson at lesser cost.

The Amazon representative has responded well and helped me to book technician's visit, which has completed on 15th May 2021.Amazon is ready for its replacement according to their 7 days replacement policy and hand to hand replacement.It was a traumatic condition for me as I have bought this phone in this COVID pandemic in very urgent condition and I badly need a phone always working 24X7 as my family was admitted in the hospital.Also, people who wish to buy it for its Camera then please beware as Samsung is advertising it as TRUE 48MP QUAD CAMERA but its result is like 8MP blurred one.Second thing is the phone is very slow and its UI is frequently NOT WORKING.Third thing is its speakers are giving old radio kind of noise.Luckily, there is no option for rating it ZERO or NEGATIVE star, else I would definitely give that rating to this product.There is ""No Return Available"" and only replacement option is given by Amazon.Only positive thing in this entire incident is that I have bought through Amazon and got their prompt support.I am very much thankful of Amazon as they have replaced this faulty device with new one on 16th May 2021, means within one day after technician visit.Now, I am only hoping that replaced SAMSUNG M12 mobile may perform to atleast ""OK"" level, if not to ""GOOD or BETTER"" standard.Dear Samsung, I will edit my review with positive points if I found the replaced product upto the mark..!!

One of the best value for money phones

Good- got it for 9999- decent phone for this cost with all the necessary gizmos and bling- finger print sensor is good. fast and sensitive. Haven't tried the face unlock.- display is top notch on any good Samsung phone for this price- quality pics/ decent ( note - I'm a normal user of camera )- battery is very good. its really a monsterBad ( depends on perspective )- slightly big for small hands- it has all the dumb samsung apps inbuilt ( you can uninstall a few )- slightly heavier when you have a good solid case ( read as spigen branded )Overall very happy to have a good ( more than decent ) phone for the initial offer price.

Average phone with bloatware : Samsung India forces to write review
","
Good phone in decent budget .Display could've been better , 90hz is not true to my usage . Since i use op7T it's clearly evident this display lacks the precision which it is said it has .Samsung India : they call me daily to inquire whether i have posted a review and what star rating should i give to the phone . This has become a headache .Dear samsung team , please do not force customer to write reviews and try to reduce the bloatware and unwanted app installations . I am starting to think MIUI was better than this .Display : not that they said / averageCamera : average / specs doesn't meetPerformance : ok for normal useBattery : good .Call quality : goodUI : Poor ,  I will not recommend samsung , this is not the one UI it was when i purchased M30S . Now this is full of bloatware and unwanted apps are getting installed by samsung store . I am puzzled on how to stop this.Overall : Very average phone . Better go for redmi note 10 or any other better phone in this price segment .Not a value for money dela

Being die hard fan of Samsung it is very difficult to write this review.Camera quality:why say 48MP  when it doesn't even look like 13MP my Mom's Samsung  M10s  camera quality and screen quality are far better than this phone. Regret for buying this phone for such high price booked on first day of launch as it came from Samsung brand. Generallyi go by reviews  but first time ordered on  launch day becoz of the reliability.I regret for the decision i made. Do not recommend the phone for anyone.

Best Phone @12499 for 6 GB RAM/128 GB ROM Variant

Pros:1. Best Battery i.e. 6000mAh.2. Good Back camera.3. Good and very necessary features by Samsung One UI. (I bet you'll like it)4. Good Performance (I use a lot of apps in multitasking but I don't play games so can't review gaming performance).5. Supports 15WT fast charging.6. Display is good according to the price range. (Don't get confused on poor display reviews.)7. Side positioned fingerprint sensor is good. (In starting you can face problems if you are currently using a back fingerprint sensor)8. Low light image from the back camera is also good. One attached in the image.9. Currently(11/04/21- 15/04/21) this phone is available @11700 (effective price)using Indusind bank cards so it is a loot deal for now. (Lowest ever price for this phone)Cons:1. Very bad front selfie camera which is 8MP (If you are a selfie addict then avoid it)2. Phone is very heavy and big in size.3. Adaptive brightness is not up to the mark.4.Animations are a little bit slow.5. Contact searching speed in the contacts app is very slow.(Resloved after update)6. After every update they install MX Takatak, Moz like apps which you can uninstall anytime. ( I think to make this phone that much affordable they are trying few methods of Mi and other Chinese brands.)Result: Best phone with all the latest features in this price range. @ 11700 - 12500Important(For those reviews who are saying the phone is slow): Got to developer options(Search Google for how to enable it ) and then Set Windows Animation Scale to .5x, Transition Animation Scale to .5x, Animator Duration to .5x. (Earlier all 3 developer options are set to 1x that's why the phone seems a little bit slow).Update: After update Contact searching speed became very good.

I bought this phone mainly for my kids online class during this pandemic. We thought to connect the mobile with our TV through HDMI adapter so that our kids can see the class directly on TV. When we tried to connect this mobile with HDMI adapter we came to know that this is not compatible with the adapter since it's USB hub is 2.0 (Don't know why Samsung configures the old USB hub for it's new mobiles). We also checked whether this mobile is MHL compatible or not? but it's not.If you are buying this mobile only for personal use then it's a good mobile. But if you are looking this mobile for your kid's online class then PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS.

Such a worst service from Amazon

Hi Guys, dont buy this mobile. Front camera is too bad although it has 8mp. Main camera has 48 mp. But still there is no night mode, continuous shots panorama options. I used to have all these options in my earlier samsung mobile which is a 3 years back model. Mobile gets heated very easily although I just use it for calls and little browsing . Display is not amoled so dont expect much quality here.Phone is too heavy to keep in pocket also. And finally amazon is not replacing phone although we complaint on the first day of receiving it, they simply arrange a technician visit in the last 7 days they arranged visit for 3 times . But no technician visits simply they call from Gujarat when mayne is Hyderabad and simply say we will replace mobile but to amazon they say everything is fine and close the ticket. So finally understand that these technicians are nothing but amazon employees only and Amazon I'd dragging till the replacement deadline ends . They never gonna replace mobile also leave about return.And finally this is my first mobile bought in Amazon. Till now I used to buy in Flipkart. I never had any issue with Flipkart. I decided not buy any electronics in amazon from now onwards. Finally I felt I wasted around 9k on this shit model from Samsung and buying in the great indian bluffing sale of amazon. Thanks to Amazon and Samsung for your wonderful committment to customer. You keep loosing for sure many customers during to ur bluffing stuff.

Miserable phone. Don't buy it.

Dear friends, believe me. Don't waste your money on this phone. This is the worst phone I have ever purchased. It is slow and hangs often. The network connectivity is very poor. My Jio 4G sim, which was working perfectly on my old phone is miserably slow on this phone. For watching YouTube videos, you have to wait for minutes for the video to load. I can't believe such a miserable phone can come from Samsung. And to crown it all, there is no option for return...! You can only request for a visit by the Amazon expert. I don't believe it will do any good.After two weeks I exchanged this rubbish with a Realme phone on Flipkart. I lost around Rs. 5000 on this deal, but it is better than suffering such s miserable thing. Because of this cheating I am leaving Amazon.

Did Not Meet Basic Expectation

The phone doesn't meet the basic expectations from at a 10k budget segment and I was surprised to find that the MRP is INR 15499. The camera is a false 48MP and not at all true and the sensor has a very poor performance. There is no support for 5Ghz Wi-Fi which is strange to find at this age of mankind. The speed and performance of this octa core processor is sloppy.The only thing good about this phone is the battery backup and the storage provided in the higher configuration. If you are buying this phone for a standby purpose, then it is fine and worth the money. If you are considering to buy this as a primary phone, take deep breaths and look further for better options in the same budget segment.Always check the manufacturer website for specification details before buying the product.

Amazon did a great job with the delivery of this product. Ordered and received on the same day.On the phone: I am happy with it. Have been using this phone for 3 days. The battery lasts for 1and half days with gaming and binge watching videos.The screen is comfortable. No issues on the screen, though  it is not amoled for an average user it is not a big difference.For the price this is a great buy, of course there is no snapdragon chip. But the exynos 850 is 8nm and at this price point is comparable to most snapdragon 6series chipsets.Camera is decent. As long as you are not a professional photographer,  this will be good enough to take atleast average if not great pics. (Some  pics are really great).This is definitely not an iPhone or one plus.

 From iPhone 6S in 2015 to iPhone 13 pro max in 2021 ,, one thing that still remains the same is it’s performance! I own an oneplus device but there is no comparison between these two! Apple made it a beast. From camera to gaming.. everything is top notch. The battery life is superb, best till now. Normal usage can go upto 3 days with full charge. Bought the earpods pro & iwatch to compliment this beast🤭

I have started using iPhone from 5 series and since then this is 7th iPhone which I upgrade and I must say till date this has got the best battery I have observed in any of my previous iPhones. Camera quality you can’t even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don’t need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it’s gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it.

I was very skeptical about the genuineness of the product that I would receive as it was not available in stock in stores. So, I brought all my gut feeling together and made this purchase. The product was delivered in time. When I opened the box, it was strikingly beautiful. I checked for its authenticity by verifying it from all different ways. Now, most importantly a genuine Apple iPhone 13 pro max phone was in my hand. It works great for me and has a longer battery life than the previous phones that I've had.

All good, except weight

Writing after one week of usage. I switched from Samsung A50 (light and good quality. was very happy)All good and enough reviews are there online. Pro max is bulky. Hand will pain after holding for 10 mins for a call or browsing. Though many reviews told that, I overlooked the aspect.Think of it before buying. It is not a small thing. You won’t appreciate all others aspects of mobile when your hand starts paining.

Best Battery. Best Camera. Very smooth. But not value for money.

Switched from Android to iPhone. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.

1st thing 1st... Look -- Very good looking phone and feel premium when you hold it.A refresh rate of 120Hz is good to feel on 13 pro max. Camera quality is just superb, pics from 13 pro max looks more real as compare to other premium segments which are using more AI and color combinations. Battery life is also outstanding, with normal use a fully charged can go up to 2 days.  Very smooth and fast performance. Just go for it.

The phone is amazing if u have an iPhone 12 dont upgrade unless you want to experience 120hz wait for the next model. My first time using IOS took sometime to get used to but definitely worth it.

Please see screenshots.Storage: Storage speed test in Antutu seems to get score of 28000. When I asked customer chat in Samsung portal, they said it is EMMC 5.1.Battery: is 5830 mAh, not exactly 6000 mAh. Better not to cheat customers by marketing a 5830 mAh battery as 6000 mAh. Instead, give an actual 6000 mAh battery.Display: seems okay, but has some dark borders at all edges of display. Borders are thicker than other phones.Camera: at low light does not identify objects well.Overall, Samsung should work on giving more value at same price by providing either UFS 2.1/3.1 storage or amoled display.Battery life: doesn't come 2 days with moderate usage. Exynos processors need to efficient not only in terms of nanometers, but also in software-hardware optimization, which seems to be lacking.Will add updates if I find any after few weeks.Edit on 23 April 2022: Light sensor is not working correctly and quickly, and proximity sensor is working very slowly. Display is not visible under sunlight.Edit on 2 May 2022: Added more screenshots. Light sensor is not identified. One of the apps shows EMMC 5.1 as storage type. Feeling my money got wasted.Edit on 13 May 2022: Touch response and phone response both are slow due to EMMC 5.1 storage. At least they could have given UFS 2.1 for INR 15,999. Both 50 MP and front 8 MP cameras have the worst clarity and quality. Please refrain from buying this device. Too many compromises are done in this phone.Edit on 20 May 2022: There have been many fake reviews seen, probably to improve the rating and feedback. Do a comprehensive and deep research before deciding to buy. This phone is not at all recommended with the worst hardware configuration - No charger, worst cameras and proximity, light sensors.

What is this, Samsung provides me only mobile phone, NO charger NO cable what is this? Every appliance every gadget provides basic accessory. Even you buy a Chinese electric toy car. They will also provide you charger. But Samsung is providing you phone with cost of rs. 20000 without charger. Ots totally unexpected. You will have to pay rs. 1700 for adaptor and rs. 600 for cable and rs. 400 For plain silicon back cover means phone total price is rs. 22700. But you can easily buy better 5g mobile with charger cable backcover along with 8GB RAM 128 GB Internal Memory @ rs. 18000-19000. So think before purchase

 Fab phone...the display is not ambled but didn't bother me due to quality... it is super fast.  I bought the 8gb version. The look and back is stylish. It is light weight although not very slim from sides.The camera looks good with all the premium features like slo mo, portrait, macro, hyperlapse etc. The performance is super smooth. The new thing is side button finger print sensor. Easy to open. Face recognition is good. Rest will post after using some time. But in this cost, it looks super worth the money. Go for it!Edit:I am surprised why is everyone talking about charger.. we have n number of chargers floating in our houses from older phones and it is a good way of reducing e waste. Also, if they would give the charger and headset, the cost goes high. So may be Samsung can create it as an option for people who want to buy with extra cost. The features of the phones are premium, except Amoled display, but look at the cost.. I think it is a bargain.The phone is fantastic. I have been using since 3 days now, excellent battery backup- 2 days with normal usage (I don't play games), super smooth and fast, and 5g is awesome (use with wifi).Edit:Major audio bug that I am facing in this phone. I requested for a replacement and guess what the replacement phone has that issue too.As soon as I put an audio app to back ground...let's say I am listening a song or an ebook via headphone and I go to home screen, it creates a loud screach and very very loud voice. U will have to take off ur earphone.The biggest issue is the replacement didn't solve this problem. I would have to go to Samsung now. :(Don't buy. Not worth it. I was using M20 for 3 years before this and it was clearly better.

Doesnt heats while gaming too.Inbuilt screen recording & call recording.Cons : No charger.Sound is pathetic. Seems like a low-cost cellphone in sound output.Camera is of not premium quality given the price.Even with a 25w charger, the charging is slightly slow.TFT screen.

VGA camera

I purchased the phone for its camera and it is an absolute waste of money.Rear and Front camera is like VGA. Pictures are very grainy and looks pixelated.Does not come with an adaptor. And the data cable that comes with it is C type. You cannot charge it until u have a laptop with C pin port or purchase the adaptor separately (which is a trick to make you spend more on the charger)I did not check other features on the phone, so I don't know about other specs.

Real User Review -Great Smartphone at Great Price .. 😀
","
Real User Review for ""Genuine Buyer"" looking for good smartphone -It's a great handset for anyone looking for good smartphone on a budget. (for 9ffice professionals and regular/normal users)Pros:- Robust build quality (as always maintained by samsung)- Good hardware specifications- Nice display (being a super amoled display user of my S20 FE, display of m33 is very close to that - very smooth and bright)- Samsung Software (so more secured and 4 years OS support)- Decent camera quality- Great battery life (6000 mah)Cons:- many complained of missing charger - but since this handset is having 6000 mah battery, so it makes complete sense to invest on 25 watts samsung charger as it will charge this big sized battery pretty fast. And type-c cable is already given in the box, so will have to buy only charger.(Anyway charging these new handsets with 15 watts charger takes lot of time)Verdict for a genuine buyer looking for real user review - Do not get mis-guided by false bad reviews.It's a great phone for the price point its available at and it's Samsung (so more reliable and secured) on software security)

Shame on Samsung for not giving a charger at this price . will curse Samsung every time I charge it light Sensors also not showing up in sensors listFront camera is just 8 mp. Other than main rear camera rest are just gimmick n almost uselessIn 2022 they are still selling tft although quality is OKPhone is full of bloatware at startup but thankfully most are removableevery now and then It heats up a bit even if no heavy task runningIn conclusion it's yet another overpriced average phone from Samsung

As already declared, charger is not provided with the phone. Who are very particular about charger with phone, they need not buy it. Performance is very good. Battery is awesome. Can handle many applications at a time without lagging. Nothing new to run in the phone since all Samsung phones are having same interface. Camera is good and video quality is also very impressive. Worth buying it if you can afford charger separately.

Defective Product screen Sucks & Over heats | very very Bulky |

I've ordered this phone right on the first day of launch considering it to be a better version and upgraded specs than M31 which I am using from last 2 years.Cons and only Cons1. Very very Bulky, feels like holding a slab of Granite in my hand2. Overheats while charging and playing games3. Despite they've provided LCD screen I guess that was in order to Save Battery, however the screen sucks. It's very low in Brightness unlike previous version of M314. Even the Camera is not Good.5. 0 rating for size.6. No charger despite paying 16k7. Samsung installs unwanted applications everytime in your phone when you update8. Worst Display in Samsung M series ever.9. No travel AdapterProsColour is greatUI is just Perfect, user delightful

This is the second time I purchase the sumsang phone and  it really land on the hope of my past experience.

Poor product and highly priced in name of introductory itself..Samsung is just looting money in making low quality phone, reducing items like headset,  charger and overly pricing for just the handset.  Not worth and quality is completely not up to mark like hearing from handset,  camera, battery.  It should have been priced 12k to get 5 stars

Excellent battery, light weight, absolutely worst camera, good processor with poor performance
","
Pros: 1. More than 24hrs of battery life (Moderate use)2. Light weight compared to the size of the battery capacity3. Not too bulky to hold, one hand operation is possible for any normal size hand.4. Superior processor (but wait)5. Responsive screen6. Good built quality, gives a premium feel.Cons. 1. Underperformance, 120hz refresh rate is just a gimmick, animations are just at par to 60hz screens.2. Display has reddish tint. Colours are not as accurate.3. Camera is the absolutely worst. Do not fall for ""50MP QUAD camera setup"". It clicks pictures as equivalent to a 5MP camera.4. Over smoothing out effect on picture ruins every click.5. Over correction of colour in Camera, pictures look unnatural.6. In low light condition, do not even bother to open the camera.7. Too many bloatware both 1st & 3rd party, took hours to debloat it.Final verdict: Spend few more bucks and get better phone or spend less and save some money, get a lower spec phone and replace every 2 years or so.PS: Still better than any other Chine*se companies (You know which are those)

do NOT buy this phone

I have now used this for almost 3 weeks now and I can confirm that this phone is NOT really worth it. I bought it after positive experience from my previous buy from this series the M31, what an awesome phone M31 is. but M335G is NOT good, camera is inferior to my M31 and the screen is also inferior, there is more bloatware which you cannot uninstall. Forced update installs more bloatware. beware of spyware included in this that installs ""recommended"" apps without your consent. The phone is heavy. On the bright side, it is slightly faster than my M31, 120 refresh screen appears silk smooth (but not by that much)Worst of all, it does not come with charger nor earphones, strange omission at this price point.

Please see screenshots.Storage: Storage speed test in Antutu seems to get score of 28000. When I asked customer chat in Samsung portal, they said it is EMMC 5.1.Battery: is 5830 mAh, not exactly 6000 mAh. Better not to cheat customers by marketing a 5830 mAh battery as 6000 mAh. Instead, give an actual 6000 mAh battery.Display: seems okay, but has some dark borders at all edges of display. Borders are thicker than other phones.Camera: at low light does not identify objects well.Overall, Samsung should work on giving more value at same price by providing either UFS 2.1/3.1 storage or amoled display.Battery life: doesn't come 2 days with moderate usage. Exynos processors need to efficient not only in terms of nanometers, but also in software-hardware optimization, which seems to be lacking.Will add updates if I find any after few weeks.Edit on 23 April 2022: Light sensor is not working correctly and quickly, and proximity sensor is working very slowly. Display is not visible under sunlight.Edit on 2 May 2022: Added more screenshots. Light sensor is not identified. One of the apps shows EMMC 5.1 as storage type. Feeling my money got wasted.Edit on 13 May 2022: Touch response and phone response both are slow due to EMMC 5.1 storage. At least they could have given UFS 2.1 for INR 15,999. Both 50 MP and front 8 MP cameras have the worst clarity and quality. Please refrain from buying this device. Too many compromises are done in this phone.Edit on 20 May 2022: There have been many fake reviews seen, probably to improve the rating and feedback. Do a comprehensive and deep research before deciding to buy. This phone is not at all recommended with the worst hardware configuration - No charger, worst cameras and proximity, light sensors.

 Loved the color and looks of the phone.  The charger is not provided which can cost u extra money.  I missed reading about the contents in the box.Rest all features are good. Samsung is as usuall having nice hardware and good operating structure.  All 6 mobiles in my home are samsung only.Should have provided with the charger to be more worthy at the price. 15999 is the price which was worth buying, hope price drops are not scary.

NO CHARGER !!! NO CABLE !!! HOW DO WE CHARGE OUR PHONE

What is this, Samsung provides me only mobile phone, NO charger NO cable what is this? Every appliance every gadget provides basic accessory. Even you buy a Chinese electric toy car. They will also provide you charger. But Samsung is providing you phone with cost of rs. 20000 without charger. Ots totally unexpected. You will have to pay rs. 1700 for adaptor and rs. 600 for cable and rs. 400 For plain silicon back cover means phone total price is rs. 22700. But you can easily buy better 5g mobile with charger cable backcover along with 8GB RAM 128 GB Internal Memory @ rs. 18000-19000. So think before purchase

 Fab phone...the display is not ambled but didn't bother me due to quality... it is super fast.  I bought the 8gb version. The look and back is stylish. It is light weight although not very slim from sides.The camera looks good with all the premium features like slo mo, portrait, macro, hyperlapse etc. The performance is super smooth. The new thing is side button finger print sensor. Easy to open. Face recognition is good. Rest will post after using some time. But in this cost, it looks super worth the money. Go for it!Edit:I am surprised why is everyone talking about charger.. we have n number of chargers floating in our houses from older phones and it is a good way of reducing e waste. Also, if they would give the charger and headset, the cost goes high. So may be Samsung can create it as an option for people who want to buy with extra cost. The features of the phones are premium, except Amoled display, but look at the cost.. I think it is a bargain.The phone is fantastic. I have been using since 3 days now, excellent battery backup- 2 days with normal usage (I don't play games), super smooth and fast, and 5g is awesome (use with wifi).Edit:Major audio bug that I am facing in this phone. I requested for a replacement and guess what the replacement phone has that issue too.As soon as I put an audio app to back ground...let's say I am listening a song or an ebook via headphone and I go to home screen, it creates a loud screach and very very loud voice. U will have to take off ur earphone.The biggest issue is the replacement didn't solve this problem. I would have to go to Samsung now. :(Don't buy. Not worth it. I was using M20 for 3 years before this and it was clearly better.

Real User Review -Great Smartphone at Great Price .. 😀
","
Real User Review for ""Genuine Buyer"" looking for good smartphone -It's a great handset for anyone looking for good smartphone on a budget. (for 9ffice professionals and regular/normal users)Pros:- Robust build quality (as always maintained by samsung)- Good hardware specifications- Nice display (being a super amoled display user of my S20 FE, display of m33 is very close to that - very smooth and bright)- Samsung Software (so more secured and 4 years OS support)- Decent camera quality- Great battery life (6000 mah)Cons:- many complained of missing charger - but since this handset is having 6000 mah battery, so it makes complete sense to invest on 25 watts samsung charger as it will charge this big sized battery pretty fast. And type-c cable is already given in the box, so will have to buy only charger.(Anyway charging these new handsets with 15 watts charger takes lot of time)Verdict for a genuine buyer looking for real user review - Do not get mis-guided by false bad reviews.It's a great phone for the price point its available at and it's Samsung (so more reliable and secured) on software security)

Despite they've provided LCD screen I guess that was in order to Save Battery, however the screen sucks. It's very low in Brightness unlike previous version of M314.

Pros: 1. More than 24hrs of battery life (Moderate use)2. Light weight compared to the size of the battery capacity3. Not too bulky to hold, one hand operation is possible for any normal size hand.4. Superior processor (but wait)5. Responsive screen6. Good built quality, gives a premium feel.Cons. 1. Underperformance, 120hz refresh rate is just a gimmick, animations are just at par to 60hz screens.2. Display has reddish tint. Colours are not as accurate.3. Camera is the absolutely worst. Do not fall for ""50MP QUAD camera setup"". It clicks pictures as equivalent to a 5MP camera.4. Over smoothing out effect on picture ruins every click.5. Over correction of colour in Camera, pictures look unnatural.6. In low light condition, do not even bother to open the camera.7. Too many bloatware both 1st & 3rd party, took hours to debloat it.Final verdict: Spend few more bucks and get better phone or spend less and save some money, get a lower spec phone and replace every 2 years or so.PS: Still better than any other Chine*se companies (You know which are those)

Forced update installs more bloatware. beware of spyware included in this that installs ""recommended"" apps without your consent. The phone is heavy.

Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it's having high end config. It doesn't look that way.Camera utterly disappointed.

Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost.

Mobile manufacturers are clearing stocks, Need to inform 5G mobile support 4G band but all 4G mobile will not support 5G.Take example, if you purchase 20,0000 mobile today, after 20 months you may need to change to 5G mobile hence it will cost you 1000 per month (costing matters) and you will not get High exchange value (not even 50% cost), Currently 5G yet to come in India, may be yearend or come will be high cost.Points to Remember while purchasing Mobile:1) Mobile band support, Dual Wi-fi Support is better.2) Graphics PPI matter hence check PPI value of mobile. It directly related to Mobile display and colour quality, Higher is better.3) Check Mobile camera F value (lower value, higher picture quality) if less than 1.8 is best. Mostly camera quality depends on Focal Value not on pixel4) Android upgrade support. This is important as your mobile will useless within 2 years, remember you don’t want any mobile who cannot upgrade to Android 11.5) Item Weight and height of mobile. Lower is better, it really matter as you will get pain while holding mobile for long time, specially  old people.6) Mobile resolution, Higher is better7) screen refresh rate, Higher is better8) Clean Android installation. This is also important as manufacturers cannot force you to install or retain any app.M12 /Pro6000 battery (not fully tested yet)Android 11, v11.0 operating system, One UI 3.1with 8nm Power Efficient Exynos850 (Octa Core 2.0GHz)90Hz screen refresh rateSamsung Brand (Non-Chinese)Galaxy Store supportDolby Atmos support.

Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn’t give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you’re choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you’ll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review

A very satisfying  experience with the device so  far.Pros:1. Long battery life-  I am a moderate  user who does everything  except gaming. That said , the battery lasts up to 2 full days.2. Decent cameras for the price. Pictures are satisfactory but could be better.3. Very responsive finger print sensor.4. Good sound quality, although dolby's impact  is not much pronounced5. UI is great and snappy. Lots of customization options.6. The display is good and smooth with 90hz refresh rate. It does make the difference.7. Fast charging works fine.Cons:1. The weight of the phone is on the heavier side @ 220 gms2. The display could have been a full HD+ @ 1080p3. No led notification light. All though there are apps that can do the job on an AMOLED screen.Overall, a good package.

Worst Samsung phone
","
This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information.

I am using this phone for the last one week and i noticed few positive and negative things about it.Positive points -• Fingerprint sensor is so fast and i loved it• Battery backup (6000 mAh) is amazing even after using it throughout the day• Camera quality is really good and the pictures are amazing on day light• Large display having a size of 6.5 inches and can run games smoothly on low graphic settings• 90Hz refresh rate feels so smooth• The phone doesn't lag or get heated after using it for a long time because of Exynos 850 (8nm) high-end processorNegative points -• Not made for hard-core gaming because the processor is not strong enough to run games smoothly on high graphics• The weight of phone is heavy• The brightness level is somewhat low as compared to other phones• The display that you will get is around 720 x 1600 pixels• The downloading as well as uploading speed is also low as compared to other phones within this price range• It is not water resistant and does not have Gorilla glass for screen protection .~ I am satisfied with this phone because of it's camera quality and battery backup √

Amazon hid all reviews for first few days till most of the stocks are sold out. Then after that it is not allowing to write negative reviews. I wrote my experience with so many negative points and it rejected. Still I am writing the pros & cons again.PROS:▪︎UI 3.0 is amazing. I like it a lot. It is better than Redmi, Moto, Nokia UI. (Subjective)▪︎Amazing battery life. I am getting more than 24hrs of usage after fully charged.CONS▪︎Worst camera ever. True 48MP is all bulls**t. Low light pics are also worst.Front camera is also not good.▪︎Seriously??? No Slowmotion, Timelapse & other basic features in camera.▪︎It doesn't support Camera2Api which means I cannot download GCam.▪︎Worst Screen resolution. While everyone is giving Super Amoled display & Full HD display, what happened to you Samsung??▪︎90Hz refresh rate is just gimmick.▪︎8nm processor is also waste.▪︎While all others are giving Snapdragon processors, Samsung is stuck with its Exynos which is basically useless. Phone is hanging sometimes.▪︎Phone is a bit heavy and you'll have a hard time with its weight. It's like holding a powerbank.▪︎15Watt charger?? Samsung...upgrade bro.▪︎Wifi only supports 2.5GHz band and no 5.0 GHz bandFinally dont get decieved by True 48MP, 8nm processor, 90Hz refresh rate and other gimmicks. You will be disappointed. I am very much disappointed. The worst thing is there is no return option in Amazon. Amazon bro...you too planned everything so well. Good job.

Don't know if I could get more disappointed by a purchase!!The phone did look okayish in the spec sheet. But it is a very  stupid buy.The first thing you notice is  the IMPRACTICALITY of the phone.It is too heavy(220g) and too thick (about 1cm) to carry. The display is the worst anyone could get at this price point.The processor is reasonably slow. Face detection is a joke. Battery is 6000 mah but will take forever to charge. But the side fingerprint sensor was good .Camera was okayish. Add a few more bucks and buy a better phone with OLED display.

Pathetic customer support
","
I bought the phone for my mother. Her usage is limited to making calls, the phone stays idle all the while. She had one more requirement that I shouldn't have to recharge it regularly. Hence choose this 6000 mAh battery phone. I was happy first few days, it gave 4+ day battery life but then an update came and spoilt everything. In 12 hours it would discharge completely. I approached the customer care and the customer care took remote access and checked logs and said, I see everything healthy in device. I told even though your log shows everything right, that doesn't translate to what I physically see. I probably had conversation for almost 10-15 mins but he was always coming to point he is not seeing problem. This was my first experience with samsung phone and this will be the last. And reason is not because product was bad but the customer support is pathetic. If I get into this kind of situation with their other products as well within a week or few weeks, I would simply waste my money. I am feeling lucky that I did not buy any of their exorbitant product and learnt the lesson at lesser cost.

 I had received this phone on 09th May 2021. For first two days it worked ok. (OK because this phone is very slow)BUT on third day, 12th May 2021, it was hanged very badly. It was neither getting switched off nor restarted..!!Immediately I have contacted the customer care for its solution. The Amazon representative has responded well and helped me to book technician's visit, which has completed on 15th May 2021.Amazon is ready for its replacement according to their 7 days replacement policy and hand to hand replacement.It was a traumatic condition for me as I have bought this phone in this COVID pandemic in very urgent condition and I badly need a phone always working 24X7 as my family was admitted in the hospital.Also, people who wish to buy it for its Camera then please beware as Samsung is advertising it as TRUE 48MP QUAD CAMERA but its result is like 8MP blurred one.Second thing is the phone is very slow and its UI is frequently NOT WORKING.Third thing is its speakers are giving old radio kind of noise.Luckily, there is no option for rating it ZERO or NEGATIVE star, else I would definitely give that rating to this product.There is ""No Return Available"" and only replacement option is given by Amazon.Only positive thing in this entire incident is that I have bought through Amazon and got their prompt support.I am very much thankful of Amazon as they have replaced this faulty device with new one on 16th May 2021, means within one day after technician visit.Now, I am only hoping that replaced SAMSUNG M12 mobile may perform to atleast ""OK"" level, if not to ""GOOD or BETTER"" standard.Dear Samsung, I will edit my review with positive points if I found the replaced product upto the mark..!!

Pros:1. Best Battery i.e. 6000mAh.2. Good Back camera.3. Good and very necessary features by Samsung One UI. (I bet you'll like it)4. Good Performance (I use a lot of apps in multitasking but I don't play games so can't review gaming performance).5. Supports 15WT fast charging.6. Display is good according to the price range. (Don't get confused on poor display reviews.)7. Side positioned fingerprint sensor is good. (In starting you can face problems if you are currently using a back fingerprint sensor)8. Low light image from the back camera is also good. One attached in the image.9. Currently(11/04/21- 15/04/21) this phone is available @11700 (effective price)using Indusind bank cards so it is a loot deal for now. (Lowest ever price for this phone)Cons:1. Very bad front selfie camera which is 8MP (If you are a selfie addict then avoid it)2. Phone is very heavy and big in size.3. Adaptive brightness is not up to the mark.4.Animations are a little bit slow.5. Contact searching speed in the contacts app is very slow.(Resloved after update)6. After every update they install MX Takatak, Moz like apps which you can uninstall anytime. ( I think to make this phone that much affordable they are trying few methods of Mi and other Chinese brands.)Result: Best phone with all the latest features in this price range. @ 11700 - 12500Important(For those reviews who are saying the phone is slow): Got to developer options(Search Google for how to enable it ) and then Set Windows Animation Scale to .5x, Transition Animation Scale to .5x, Animator Duration to .5x. (Earlier all 3 developer options are set to 1x that's why the phone seems a little bit slow).Update: After update Contact searching speed became very good.

Initially i given 4 star and after few months of usage can see the sound quality degraded and very feeble .. camera outcome is not that much quality as they promised in d specs ..Samsung average phone at average price to meet out china companies competency..My old reviewI have bought 6GB Ram phone as I am long time user of Samsung and downgraded from high end series to this M series. D main reason u need to go for Samsung compared to China model phones is the SAR .SAR for this phone model is 1.19W/KG which is within the 1.6 range .Sound quality okayPicture quality is okay and not badBattery draining not that muchEase of navigation good 👍Performance is goodThis phone comes with backside Matt finish and not glossy finish ..tats s only cosmetic changes compared to M31 series ..Over all okay 👌🙂 ..head set won't be there which they mention in the items that they will provide..Overall decent price 👌

Edit1: adding on after using it for a few months, the call quality is terrible and microphone is also not working properly, Please look after other ones, waste of moneyThough the battery life is great, the charge time is long. Don't buy it. The performance  drop is so exaggerated. We can't switch between  apps without waiting for 3 to 4 seconds minimum.  Camera quality is bad as well.Edit 2:Worst mobile I have ever bought. Never buy it. There are lots of bugs, wifi calling gets switched off automatically, Sim signal service are irritating. Bluetooth is of inferior quality. Lte settings change automatically.

48mo camera a dream

Very bad product.I never think such a product will come from Samsung.It had 48 MP only for show.Photos are not clear .On checking the photo size I found that 12mp again I was astonished I contacted customer care of Samsung they told me to change the camera setting 48 MP then I got photo in 48mp the clear not better than previous one .It gives very low quality photo again.It was my experience.I had bought by dreaming photo clarity.Net work problem is usually Samsung problem here .The only better thing in this phone is battery and quick charging

Excellent Battery  and budget
","
I have been using this phone for more than a week and below is my feedback.1. Excellent battery and its lasts for 2 days at least on normal usage.2. Phone performance is good for normal usage such as YouTube,  Facebook or watsapp and usual games.3. Look and feel is good, easy to use.4. Phone is quite I feel probably due to battery  capacity.5. Front camera is not good but back one is good. This maybe great for selfie  lovers.6. Phone doesn't hang when multiple apps are opened.7. Worthy product  for this price based on spec and quality.I have attached  the photos taken and also same pic taken using both front and back camera  to show  the difference.  Overall it's a good budget Phone with all nice features and excellent battery.

Slowest anf dumbest phone on phone, do not buy , don't go on it's cost

Call button speed:Worst phone speed, it take at least 10 seconds to start dial once you touch the dial button.Face detection:If you put Khichdi mixture on gas , and simultaneously try to unlock phone with face detection, I am sure khichdi will get cooked faster than your face detection.Finger scan unlock-Lock button amd finger scan button are same, and stopped working within month.Camera quality:Sony Ericsson 2Mega pixel cera of 2006 had better clarity than thia camera.Working speed:This phone is winner in speed race, if you remember the tortoise and rabbit story.Moral of the story :Worst phine by samsung

Such a worst service from Amazon

Hi Guys, dont buy this mobile. Front camera is too bad although it has 8mp. Main camera has 48 mp. But still there is no night mode, continuous shots panorama options. I used to have all these options in my earlier samsung mobile which is a 3 years back model. Mobile gets heated very easily although I just use it for calls and little browsing . Display is not amoled so dont expect much quality here.Phone is too heavy to keep in pocket also. And finally amazon is not replacing phone although we complaint on the first day of receiving it, they simply arrange a technician visit in the last 7 days they arranged visit for 3 times . But no technician visits simply they call from Gujarat when mayne is Hyderabad and simply say we will replace mobile but to amazon they say everything is fine and close the ticket. So finally understand that these technicians are nothing but amazon employees only and Amazon I'd dragging till the replacement deadline ends . They never gonna replace mobile also leave about return.And finally this is my first mobile bought in Amazon. Till now I used to buy in Flipkart. I never had any issue with Flipkart. I decided not buy any electronics in amazon from now onwards. Finally I felt I wasted around 9k on this shit model from Samsung and buying in the great indian bluffing sale of amazon. Thanks to Amazon and Samsung for your wonderful committment to customer. You keep loosing for sure many customers during to ur bluffing stuff.

Miserable phone. Don't buy it.
","
Dear friends, believe me. Don't waste your money on this phone. This is the worst phone I have ever purchased. It is slow and hangs often. The network connectivity is very poor. My Jio 4G sim, which was working perfectly on my old phone is miserably slow on this phone. For watching YouTube videos, you have to wait for minutes for the video to load. I can't believe such a miserable phone can come from Samsung. And to crown it all, there is no option for return...! You can only request for a visit by the Amazon expert. I don't believe it will do any good.After two weeks I exchanged this rubbish with a Realme phone on Flipkart. I lost around Rs. 5000 on this deal, but it is better than suffering such s miserable thing. Because of this cheating I am leaving Amazon.

Did Not Meet Basic Expectation
","
The phone doesn't meet the basic expectations from at a 10k budget segment and I was surprised to find that the MRP is INR 15499. The camera is a false 48MP and not at all true and the sensor has a very poor performance. There is no support for 5Ghz Wi-Fi which is strange to find at this age of mankind. The speed and performance of this octa core processor is sloppy.The only thing good about this phone is the battery backup and the storage provided in the higher configuration. If you are buying this phone for a standby purpose, then it is fine and worth the money. If you are considering to buy this as a primary phone, take deep breaths and look further for better options in the same budget segment.Always check the manufacturer website for specification details before buying the product.

Very worst phone. Just waste of money and time. I did not any support from Samsung team and Amazon. The battery and charger getting heated up. When I call Samsung customer service they said as you have purchased from Amazon they will not support. Amazon team say that as this a Samsung phone you can call them. They are playing games and I was completely cheated by them. If you purchase from Amazon Samsung team no warranty for this product is only 7 days from the day of purchase.So be careful before you purchase the electronic from Amazon you can get cheated them.I have paid RS 11000 towards this phone.

I am using 4GB ram and its very very slow and very lagging..very versatile very horrible3. Finger print scanner everytime i get error message could not detect correct impression try again4.

Voice break always happens, where as all my other mobile works fone.- All applications are very slow and crashes. (Faulty software even after updates).- Sound system including ring tone is very low.- Hotspot goes off multiple times without any reason.- Battery backup 12-14 hours and takes too long to charge- No support from Samsung (Closed 3 tickets without responding)Please don't buy, you will waste yor money.

Good phone for a great price. Not a snapdragon chip, but that is not an issue.

Amazon did a great job with the delivery of this product. Ordered and received on the same day.On the phone: I am happy with it. Have been using this phone for 3 days. The battery lasts for 1and half days with gaming and binge watching videos.The screen is comfortable. No issues on the screen, though  it is not amoled for an average user it is not a big difference.For the price this is a great buy, of course there is no snapdragon chip. But the exynos 850 is 8nm and at this price point is comparable to most snapdragon 6series chipsets.Camera is decent. As long as you are not a professional photographer,  this will be good enough to take atleast average if not great pics. (Some  pics are really great).This is definitely not an iPhone or one plus. But for the price it definitely is great.

This is a sincere review after using this crazy Samsung mobile for more than a month. THIS THE WORST MODEL EVER RELEASED BY SAMSUNG AND MARKETTED BY AMAZON. The mobile does not charge properly and I raised a complaint on the same with Amazon on the 3rd day of my purchase. They said a technician will checkbit. The tech did check and co firmed this could get replaced, however there was no bledy action from Amazon. The charging problem slowly got rectified without anything done with it. Later since yesterday I see the same problem again. I don't a reason  why I shut bled spend 11k on such a crazy phone. I lost all the impression I had on Amazon with this purchase. DO NOT BUYTHIS MODEL AT ALL.

 The touch stops working after 5min of use. This phone is really pathetic. I requested for return and amazon sent technician, he came and he agreed that there was touch issue but then he has filed that there is no issue, he even asked me to send the videos on whatsapp, which i did. I feel really cheated by Amazon, then when i call the technician again, he has actually blocked my number. I saw reviews from other customers who have faced the same issue, please don't buy this phone if you don't  want to suffer like i did.  After speaking 15min with customer care they have agreed to send one more technician. I hope this time they do the right thing.

""Sir, I am really sorry however, M12 supports 802.11 b/g/n 2.4GHz.""- This is the response from Samsung customer service when I inquired why not able to detect to my Router 5G. Even 6K Chinese mobiles have 5G detection - so before you buy think and check as the mobile has very limited features. The battery life is not great while it is 6000.... and camera is very normal standard. The mobile as a whole is a big compromise to the cost and is not a value for money product.

So, i am going to give you guyz an honest review of this phone. First of all the UI and multi tasking of this phone is excellent. But there were most of the things realme says they added in the phone but they are just door ka dikhawa. The screen doesn't have the refresh rate of 120Hz in most of the cases. When you watch movies and play games the refresh rate turns to 60Hz. The camera quality is not very good, also i have faced lags whenever i capturing something. When i played bgmi on this device the maximum fps it could give was 40fps, yeah i faced a minor lag in bgmi if i am recording the screen while playing. Everything else was good if you are using this device for regular use, but the camera lag and quality wasn't expected with this amount of money. So, think twice before buying this phone. Because if you want to play games and records them or you want to capture moments with your camera its important you have better device than this one.

After 3 Days of Use :The Phone contains good Gaming Processor Mediatek Halio G96 processor which performance is smooth and excellent, 120 Hz refresh rate but IPS LED display, with video support upto 2k, excellent display.Build is solid but plastic. No information about screen so I put tampered glass. It is large and wide screen phone, which will provide you enhanced gaming experience.Heptic Feedback is good.Face recognition and Finger print sencor works smooth. Finger print scanner contains 2 mode -- Light touch (just touch to open) and Firm touch (press button then scan).Single speaker - decent sound, no noise cancellation microphone but no issues in speaking in traffic or background sound voices are pretty clear.Dissapointing is Android 11 but it will provide update. No 5g or 4G+.Best Camera in this price range. If you are a camera guy you can go for it, no ultra wide angle.. 2 sample images taken.Conclusion:- According to me its is a complete phone under 13k. Phone is good, camera is excellent, Smooth processor. Overall recomended.***Note : - If you want 4g+, Ultra Wide Camera and IPS LCD display no amoled don't go for this phone.

After 3 Days of Use :The Phone contains good Gaming Processor Mediatek Halio G96 processor which performance is smooth and excellent, 120 Hz refresh rate but IPS LED display, with video support upto 2k, excellent display.Build is solid but plastic. No information about screen so I put tampered glass. It is large and wide screen phone, which will provide you enhanced gaming experience.Heptic Feedback is good.Face recognition and Finger print sencor works smooth. Finger print scanner contains 2 mode -- Light touch (just touch to open) and Firm touch (press button then scan).Single speaker - decent sound, no noise cancellation microphone but no issues in speaking in traffic or background sound voices are pretty clear.Dissapointing is Android 11 but it will provide update. No 5g or 4G+.Best Camera in this price range. If you are a camera guy you can go for it, no ultra wide angle.. 2 sample images taken.Conclusion:- According to me its is a complete phone under 13k. Phone is good, camera is excellent, Smooth processor. Overall recomended.***Note : - If you want 4g+, Ultra Wide Camera and IPS LCD display no amoled don't go for this phone.

Good but lots of bloatware and telemetry.
","
👍🏽 Smooth performance. Really rapid charging. Light weight. Fine display & camera.👎🏽 Lots of unwanted pre installed apps, many of which can't uninstall or even can't disable. Hence lots of telemetry which is a serious privacy concern.🤗 There is a solution to some extent 👉🏽 use NetGuard app to block suspicious system app's net connection. Activate private DNS with 'dns.adguard.com' (due to some bugs in phone's software it will show 'cannot connect to .....', but ignore this).Then using Brave browser go to 'ipleak.net' to confirm that private DNS is working.After these settings this phone is better then any other phone of same class. 👏🏽

The phone is great for gaming and day to day work but not too great when it comes to the front camera but that can be expected from a device at this price point. The speakers are loud and the brightness is good and overall performance is as great as ever. Buy the 6gb variant and I promise you won't regret it.

Totally worth it for its price. If possible go for the 6gb variant. You get 6gb dedicated ram + option to increase 5gb virtual ram on top of it. In this price range you won't find anything better than this at least for now.

The realme UI is trash
","
I decided to try reallme after using redmi phones for 7 years, the realme ui is trash, it keeps forcing bloatware on you. The bloatware appears randomly even after uninstalling it. The camera ui has input lags, when u lock an app using the built-in applock the phone ont show u notifications, you wnt see who and what message has been snt unless u enter the app  again. The EIS is laggy when u record video using stabiliyy on, it will be contorted an stuff, you're better off buying redmi phones.

If u want good camera then don't but this phone, if camera is not priority then is is a good phone
","
If got this phone in 10000 after applying 1500 coupon code and 1500 card discount, so at this price point if we compare it with other phones then, it got a better screen, screen colours are good and it is smooth, battery is good and charger is fast, it takes almost 80 min for a full charge, camera is dissapointing, very poor camera quality, noisy photos in indoor, in outdoor photos are bright but clarity is not good, images are not sharp, it seems like a 13 mp camera, front camera is ok ok not so much better, design is ok, speakers are good, it could be better if sterio speakers are available, if u are getting this phone in 13000 then you should definately go for redmi note 11 , no doubt redmi note 11 is far better than this, I got it in 9999 so I buy this, also processor is ok in this phone but heating problem is still there

Brightness ness very very low and we can't even seen and i have called to amazon, they simply said it's quality problem we can't change, you should check quality and buy the phone before buying. We can't replace and we cnat return. It's not my responsibility and not even we can't send technician also. They directly said it's not amazon issue. You should speak realme company. All my money gone simply throughout the mobile and no other option. Amazon customer care said we have rules before buying you should check.

Considering the price after 2000 flat discount, the phone is literally good for all the day to day activities and multi tasking. Though, it's a gaming processor but I have not tested it for the same. Clearly lot better than redmi note 11 in terms of performance and camera. Redmi's has better screen but rest all features are better in narzo 50.

A MEDIOCRE PHONE-BEST FOR STANDBY USAGE
","
I bought this as I only wanted it to be a standby phone. The phone is not as good as per the specifications. The camera quality is very poor for 48 MP. Battery back up is ok. lasts for a whole day. No lags observed for normal usage. I faced disturbances with the mic if I put on the silicone cover that comes with the phone. There were a hell lot of bloatware when I switched on the phone. Charging takes 90 mins for a 100%.You can go for a better phone at this price, if you use only a single phone. I dont find anything that is appreciable in this phone.

Okay so its been a 15 days that I am using the realme narzo50. I ordered it on 13th march and it was delivered on 20th march.Here is the pros and cons about this phone.Pros:-1.Good processor(Helio g96 12nm based)2.Good battery size.(5000mah)3.Fast charger out of the box(33w)4.Good thermal controll during gaming5.Good screen refresh rate(120hz) and TSR(180hz)6.Decent camera quality7.Sound quality is good through one speaker.Cons:-1.Still running on Android 11(Realme UI 2.0)2.Ram management is not good.3.slow UFS 2.1( may be subjective to others)4.Graphis is ok but not good compaired to adreno.5.No Carrier agrregation.6.Noticed some minor lags in UI7.Screen flickers at very low brightness.(May be due to IPS LCD)

Good Phone if you buy 4/64 gb varient @ ₹11,000

Pros- camera is good , screen refresh rate is good , build quality is good , Sound quality is good , Battery is good for day to day uses , all sensor work good , no any heating issue .Cons- Feel heavy in one hand use, Battery drain fast when you do very heavy tasks and play game and some time you feel little more heat that will be manageable, screen brightness not good means why refresh rate is good but brightness is not good it can be better when it has 1000 nits but it has only 600 nits, and which type of screen protection is used Realme  don't know... Overall if You buy it in 11k than it is good at this price range,but under 13k it is not good ...

Please don’t buy this product. Worst product and worst experience with delivery boy and customer service of Amazon. After getting worst experience we should n’t buy anything from Amazon. The phone didn’t recognise the SIM hence IMEI not coming. Hence we opt for replacement. But 4 times his boy came and didn’t take the phone because they couldn’t verify the IMEI no. And we were returning due to this problem only. We talked many times to customer care and every time they assured for return. But each time there rude delivery boys come and didn’t take the phone because IMEI no not there which was the main problem. And the phone is still with me waiting for a day when it will go for return.

Please see screenshots.Storage: Storage speed test in Antutu seems to get score of 28000. When I asked customer chat in Samsung portal, they said it is EMMC 5.1.Battery: is 5830 mAh, not exactly 6000 mAh. Better not to cheat customers by marketing a 5830 mAh battery as 6000 mAh. Instead, give an actual 6000 mAh battery.Display: seems okay, but has some dark borders at all edges of display. Borders are thicker than other phones.Camera: at low light does not identify objects well.Overall, Samsung should work on giving more value at same price by providing either UFS 2.1/3.1 storage or amoled display.Battery life: doesn't come 2 days with moderate usage. Exynos processors need to efficient not only in terms of nanometers, but also in software-hardware optimization, which seems to be lacking.Will add updates if I find any after few weeks.Edit on 23 April 2022: Light sensor is not working correctly and quickly, and proximity sensor is working very slowly. Display is not visible under sunlight.Edit on 2 May 2022: Added more screenshots. Light sensor is not identified. One of the apps shows EMMC 5.1 as storage type. Feeling my money got wasted.Edit on 13 May 2022: Touch response and phone response both are slow due to EMMC 5.1 storage. At least they could have given UFS 2.1 for INR 15,999. Both 50 MP and front 8 MP cameras have the worst clarity and quality. Please refrain from buying this device. Too many compromises are done in this phone.Edit on 20 May 2022: There have been many fake reviews seen, probably to improve the rating and feedback. Do a comprehensive and deep research before deciding to buy. This phone is not at all recommended with the worst hardware configuration - No charger, worst cameras and proximity, light sensors.

What is this, Samsung provides me only mobile phone, NO charger NO cable what is this? Every appliance every gadget provides basic accessory. Even you buy a Chinese electric toy car. They will also provide you charger. But Samsung is providing you phone with cost of rs. 20000 without charger. Ots totally unexpected. You will have to pay rs. 1700 for adaptor and rs. 600 for cable and rs. 400 For plain silicon back cover means phone total price is rs. 22700. But you can easily buy better 5g mobile with charger cable backcover along with 8GB RAM 128 GB Internal Memory @ rs. 18000-19000. So think before purchase

 Fab phone...the display is not ambled but didn't bother me due to quality... it is super fast.  I bought the 8gb version. The look and back is stylish. It is light weight although not very slim from sides.The camera looks good with all the premium features like slo mo, portrait, macro, hyperlapse etc. The performance is super smooth. The new thing is side button finger print sensor. Easy to open. Face recognition is good. Rest will post after using some time. But in this cost, it looks super worth the money. Go for it!Edit:I am surprised why is everyone talking about charger.. we have n number of chargers floating in our houses from older phones and it is a good way of reducing e waste. Also, if they would give the charger and headset, the cost goes high. So may be Samsung can create it as an option for people who want to buy with extra cost. The features of the phones are premium, except Amoled display, but look at the cost.. I think it is a bargain.The phone is fantastic. I have been using since 3 days now, excellent battery backup- 2 days with normal usage (I don't play games), super smooth and fast, and 5g is awesome (use with wifi).Edit:Major audio bug that I am facing in this phone. I requested for a replacement and guess what the replacement phone has that issue too.As soon as I put an audio app to back ground...let's say I am listening a song or an ebook via headphone and I go to home screen, it creates a loud screach and very very loud voice. U will have to take off ur earphone.The biggest issue is the replacement didn't solve this problem. I would have to go to Samsung now. :(Don't buy. Not worth it. I was using M20 for 3 years before this and it was clearly better.

","
Upgraded from m31 to m33.Just loving it.Ultra smooth as butter and responsive.For some reason doesn't feel heavy as I expected.Very happy with it. Display is just fine even though supposedly not sAmoled.Bought 25W charger as it was in  discount as a bundled offer.I chose due to latest 1280 5nm processor and Android 12 out of the box with assured upgrades to Android 13 when available.Will update over next few days.

 day 1- packaging was really bad, no bubble wraps nothing but the phone is thankfully okay.Camera is alright and the screen is good too, doesn't look like cheap tft displays. Turned off 120 hz because that was laggy, samsung shouldn't put that in lcd only works well on amoleds. Anyways, overall a good phone.I know there are better options in this price range obviously but I'd rather not buy chinese products so only good choices left are samsung or apple and apple doesn't the most affordable tech out there.

I purchased the phone for its camera and it is an absolute waste of money.Rear and Front camera is like VGA. Pictures are very grainy and looks pixelated.Does not come with an adaptor.

You cannot charge it until u have a laptop with C pin port or purchase the adaptor separately (which is a trick to make you spend more on the charger)I did not check other features on the phone, so I don't know about other specs.

Real User Review -Great Smartphone at Great Price .. 😀
","
Real User Review for ""Genuine Buyer"" looking for good smartphone -It's a great handset for anyone looking for good smartphone on a budget. (for 9ffice professionals and regular/normal users)Pros:- Robust build quality (as always maintained by samsung)- Good hardware specifications- Nice display (being a super amoled display user of my S20 FE, display of m33 is very close to that - very smooth and bright)- Samsung Software (so more secured and 4 years OS support)- Decent camera quality- Great battery life (6000 mah)Cons:- many complained of missing charger - but since this handset is having 6000 mah battery, so it makes complete sense to invest on 25 watts samsung charger as it will charge this big sized battery pretty fast. And type-c cable is already given in the box, so will have to buy only charger.(Anyway charging these new handsets with 15 watts charger takes lot of time)Verdict for a genuine buyer looking for real user review - Do not get mis-guided by false bad reviews.It's a great phone for the price point its available at and it's Samsung (so more reliable and secured) on software security)

As already declared, charger is not provided with the phone. Who are very particular about charger with phone, they need not buy it. Performance is very good. Battery is awesome. Can handle many applications at a time without lagging. Nothing new to run in the phone since all Samsung phones are having same interface. Camera is good and video quality is also very impressive. Worth buying it if you can afford charger separately.

Defective Product screen Sucks & Over heats | very very Bulky |

I've ordered this phone right on the first day of launch considering it to be a better version and upgraded specs than M31 which I am using from last 2 years.Cons and only Cons1. Very very Bulky, feels like holding a slab of Granite in my hand2. Overheats while charging and playing games3. Despite they've provided LCD screen I guess that was in order to Save Battery, however the screen sucks. It's very low in Brightness unlike previous version of M314. Even the Camera is not Good.5. 0 rating for size.6. No charger despite paying 16k7. Samsung installs unwanted applications everytime in your phone when you update8. Worst Display in Samsung M series ever.9. No travel AdapterProsColour is greatUI is just Perfect, user delightful

This is the second time I purchase the sumsang phone and  it really land on the hope of my past experience.

Excellent battery, light weight, absolutely worst camera, good processor with poor performance
","
Pros: 1. More than 24hrs of battery life (Moderate use)2. Light weight compared to the size of the battery capacity3. Not too bulky to hold, one hand operation is possible for any normal size hand.4. Superior processor (but wait)5. Responsive screen6. Good built quality, gives a premium feel.Cons. 1. Underperformance, 120hz refresh rate is just a gimmick, animations are just at par to 60hz screens.2. Display has reddish tint. Colours are not as accurate.3. Camera is the absolutely worst. Do not fall for ""50MP QUAD camera setup"". It clicks pictures as equivalent to a 5MP camera.4. Over smoothing out effect on picture ruins every click.5. Over correction of colour in Camera, pictures look unnatural.6. In low light condition, do not even bother to open the camera.7. Too many bloatware both 1st & 3rd party, took hours to debloat it.Final verdict: Spend few more bucks and get better phone or spend less and save some money, get a lower spec phone and replace every 2 years or so.PS: Still better than any other Chine*se companies (You know which are those)

do NOT buy this phone

I have now used this for almost 3 weeks now and I can confirm that this phone is NOT really worth it. I bought it after positive experience from my previous buy from this series the M31, what an awesome phone M31 is. but M335G is NOT good, camera is inferior to my M31 and the screen is also inferior, there is more bloatware which you cannot uninstall. Forced update installs more bloatware. beware of spyware included in this that installs ""recommended"" apps without your consent. The phone is heavy. On the bright side, it is slightly faster than my M31, 120 refresh screen appears silk smooth (but not by that much)Worst of all, it does not come with charger nor earphones, strange omission at this price point.

I've always wanted to get a S Series flagship. I have always wanted to get a Note Series flagship. Now I have both of them in the S22 Ultra.After a long wait, Samsung finally merged the S and Note series which was inevitable and I am glad they did.The S22 Ultra is the phone to beat this year. Samsung launched the S series earlier than expected and we have already got a phone of the year contender 3 months into the year. Don't think it gets any better than this no matter what flagship any competition introduces.Before this, I was using One Plus 7 Pro and the S22 Ultra makes it feel like a Xiaomi phone. I was not ready to be blown away considering that OP7P is a pretty good phone to begin with. But it improves on every aspect of a 2-3 year old flagship and this is Android at it's peak (until Samsung comes out with another banger next year)It goes without saying that the camera on S22 Ultra is the highlight followed by the S-Pen. And the conversation cannot be considered over until we mention the 100x zoom. I am amazed every time I do comparison shots where I take a normal picture and then a 100x zoom and find a detail which is not possible to see with the naked eye. I'll let you be the judge after going through the pictures I have uploaded (the pigeon vs the park).The display puts other mobile based OLED screens to shame. It is difficult to describe in words and you will have to see it for yourself, but the colors, sharpness of the text, adaptive refresh rate, QHD+ resolution is a sight to behold if you don't care about the battery life (which I don't) and I chose to not make any compromises with my experience of using this phone.The S-Pen which a lot of people have said to be a gimmick is a very nice addition and I find myself using it more often than not while browsing internet or simply watching YouTube. I really like the ""Smart Select"" feature which enables you to take screenshots and crop pictures on the fly. Definitely been using it a lot more than I should.There are a lot more detailed reviews out there which would tell you the specs and other features, but you probably don't need to know all the technical aspects of it. All you need to know is this is a- Snapdragon version- Has an updated GPU (gaming performance has vastly improved if you are into mobile gaming)- S-Pen latency has vastly improved- 45W fast charging (get a charging brick from Samsung, or any reputed third party like Spigen)All in all, if money is not an object and you want a phone which provides an uncompromising experience. This is the way.

A great phone to restart broken relationship

I have had my relationship broken with Samsung 12 years ago because of the unethical behaviour of their service center staff. The staff broke my phone after an argument when they were not able to fix an issue in the new phone even after 3 visits. And, Samsung did nothing even after filing a complaint.In last 12 years I have used 14 major flagship devices from different companies. But didn't bought any Samsung goods.Today, after 12 years I dicided to give second and last chance to Samsung. Pre-booked this phone. Hope this will be good experience now.Here is my observation after using this device a few days.Pros:1. Awesome build quality.2. Camera (and zoom) is next level3. Speakers are loud with quality sound.4. Good network modem. My iPhone 13 struggles to get network coverage inside the home but there are full signals in Samsung phone from the same network operator.5. S pen is great addition to the S series and it works really well and fast.6. Display is really smooth and awesome7. Very touch sensitive.8. One UI seems to be promising.9. And finally, it does include the Snapdragon processor in India unit this time instead their inferior Exynos processor which helps in improving battery life and image processing.Cons:1. Doesn't come up with charging adapter. In the name of environment they fool customers to buy chargers saperately to make some extra bucks.2. Having a case inside box would have been nice like OnePlus provides one.3. There was no screen protector applied to tne display. So if you want to protect screen from the day 1, buy 1 screen protector along with the phone.4. Slower than last gen OnePlus 9 pro (12GB - 256GB). I compared keeping them side by side and disappointed by the Samsung in terms of App installation speed and gaming performance.

 This is truly the best phone money can buy, especially if you are already in the Android ecosystem. The  S22 Ultra is an amped-up Galaxy Note with a faster S Pen built in, lots of camera improvements, a brighter display and faster charging.This is a stellar phone overall. S Pen is more responsive, as Samsung made it 70% faster with less latency.Galaxy S22 Ultra's biggest upgrades come with its cameras, as Samsung is shooting to overtake the iPhone 13 Pro Max and Google Pixel 6 Pro as the best camera phone.Key features I love:Best phone display yet: The Galaxy S22 Ultra's AMOLED panel is not only brighter than the competition, making it ideal for outdoor viewing, it delivers better color saturation.The S Pen is better: By reducing the latency by 70%, writing and drawing on the Galaxy S22 Ultra feels as smooth as pen and paper. And there's a holster built in.Better photos (especially in low light): Thanks to a bigger main sensor, the Galaxy S22 Ultra delivers brighter pictures than the S21 Ultra, and the Night Mode works even better than the iPhone 13 Pro Max in certain scenarios.Longer support: Samsung is promising five years of update support and four years of major OS updates, so this flagship should be able to last you a long time.Sleek and durable design: The Galaxy S22 Ultra is protected by an armor aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus+ back, and yet it's lighter than the iPhone 13 Pro Max without a lame notch. Some may not dig the curved display, though.45W charging is fast (but not that fast): The phone got to 67% in 30 minutes, which is not that much faster than 25W (58%).

 Let me start with my review as I migrated from Apple ecosystem and post experience I would say Samsung S22 ultra is a marvel of engineering. I had purchased this my phone early bird offer and still falling in love of the design, curves, precision and fluidic OneUI by Samsung.Hardware:World leading SoC make Samsung 22 Ultra to perform like a beast during multi tasking.Camera placements are stunning and industry first sensor and brings every one's attention towards the device.Highest ever brightness display feel same for my vision and Dynamic AMOLED exhibits vision as super true vision.S Pen - Ahh Spen !!! signature and adds a jewel value to the phone and I feel to always use Samsung s22 with Spen45W - Charger I used for my Samsung S22 Ultra is a power house and uses every cell of Lithium to give a truly maximum standby and usage time.Software:OneUI - Cute, Fluidic, top notch features covered by the Software of Samsung which is one of the leading mobile software in the universe.Camera - I still feel jaw dropped on the camera performance on the precision shots, deep zoom shots and ultra wide experience. This shows the maximum expertise of the R&D division of Samsung's excellence which none other manufacturer like Apple, OnePlus cant even reach near. Super flawless.Samsung S22 Ultra is an engineering, photography marvel of the universe and I would say this is one of the best decision to purchase Samsung S22 Ultra in my lifetime.. Proud to recommend for new buyers.

I have observed some display color density issues with written words as i scroll the pages.The words become thick and darker as you touch the screen ,becoming normal as you remove finger touch from phone.This is very irritating, giving headache.I have observed this thing for the first time in a Samsung flagship. There are no such issues with my Note 10 plus.I have seen this issue with some cheap phones,but for God sake this is the flagship from Samsung,with this price you expect nothing but perfection.I have put a return/replacement request,so some technician will visit and see my phone.I will let you all know the result of this inspection ,whether he tries to solve the problem or pushes me to accept the phone by accepting the inconvenience.Update 1-The technician was very cordial,listened to my complaints and made a report,on the basis of which my replacement request has been accepted.Great experience!I will update my star ratings again after i receive the replacement.Update 2- I received the replacement and it is working perfectly fine.My final review is here now.Amazon delivery and problem solving 5/5The Seller Appario retail 5/5Phone looks and display 10/5Performance 5/5Battery 4/5Camera 5/5I have updated my star ratings to 5/5 now.This phone is a thing of beauty!

The battery life is terrible. The camera has got good macro and decent zoom. Nothing extraordinary. I'm actually quite disappointed, I bought the phone after the paid YouTube reviews. My 13k phone takes pictures with similar quality. The AI is nice and that's it.

 Let me start with my review as I migrated from Apple ecosystem and post experience I would say Samsung S22 ultra is a marvel of engineering. I had purchased this my phone early bird offer and still falling in love of the design, curves, precision and fluidic OneUI by Samsung.Hardware:World leading SoC make Samsung 22 Ultra to perform like a beast during multi tasking.Camera placements are stunning and industry first sensor and brings every one's attention towards the device.Highest ever brightness display feel same for my vision and Dynamic AMOLED exhibits vision as super true vision.S Pen - Ahh Spen !!! signature and adds a jewel value to the phone and I feel to always use Samsung s22 with Spen45W - Charger I used for my Samsung S22 Ultra is a power house and uses every cell of Lithium to give a truly maximum standby and usage time.Software:OneUI - Cute, Fluidic, top notch features covered by the Software of Samsung which is one of the leading mobile software in the universe.Camera - I still feel jaw dropped on the camera performance on the precision shots, deep zoom shots and ultra wide experience. This shows the maximum expertise of the R&D division of Samsung's excellence which none other manufacturer like Apple, OnePlus cant even reach near. Super flawless.Samsung S22 Ultra is an engineering, photography marvel of the universe and I would say this is one of the best decision to purchase Samsung S22 Ultra in my lifetime.. Proud to recommend for new buyers.

I have observed some display color density issues with written words as i scroll the pages.The words become thick and darker as you touch the screen ,becoming normal as you remove finger touch from phone.This is very irritating, giving headache.I have observed this thing for the first time in a Samsung flagship. There are no such issues with my Note 10 plus.I have seen this issue with some cheap phones,but for God sake this is the flagship from Samsung,with this price you expect nothing but perfection.I have put a return/replacement request,so some technician will visit and see my phone.I will let you all know the result of this inspection ,whether he tries to solve the problem or pushes me to accept the phone by accepting the inconvenience.Update 1-The technician was very cordial,listened to my complaints and made a report,on the basis of which my replacement request has been accepted.Great experience!I will update my star ratings again after i receive the replacement.Update 2- I received the replacement and it is working perfectly fine.My final review is here now.Amazon delivery and problem solving 5/5The Seller Appario retail 5/5Phone looks and display 10/5Performance 5/5Battery 4/5Camera 5/5I have updated my star ratings to 5/5 now.This phone is a thing of beauty!

Amazon packaging and Samsung packaging seal were already opened(have a video for unpacking) .But since I was too excited I just ignored that and went ahead and switched on the phone. Later found out that phone is heating even with just playing music and browsing. Im not sure how it will behave for heavy load.And now Amazon is saying since I have switched on it they can't take it back.I'm just regretting that why I invested this much in online shopping should have gone for Authorised shop.

The complete package
","
The S22 Ultra is easily the most powerful and versatile Android phone on the market right now.From the gorgeous crisp display to the ridiculously stunning camera & haptics, every small feature, is as good as it gets!Right off the bat, the build quality feels premium and I've been a fan of the minimalist camera cutouts from the start, even though it does gather some dust...Coming to the S-pen, originally I thought it would be a ""good to have"" gadget, which I'd forget about eventually, but BOY was I wrong...The ability to take notes is a nifty feature for sure, but it doesn't end there.... From air gestures to smart select to translate, its honestly insane how much this small tool can accomplish, and I haven't even scratched the surface of its capabilities.The performance from Snapdragon 8 gen 1 (rather than the Exynos) is unbeatable.I wasn't a fan of One UI in the past but I am surprised at how much they've managed to polish it up with One UI 4.Plus, if you want to customize your phone even further, make sure you install the Good Lock app by Samsung, it opens up a whole new world for the tinkerers like me :)The only gripe I have is with the battery. Its not the best out there, but considering the performance you're getting in return, its more than fair to cut it some slack.All in all, yes, its pricey. But, you get what you pay for, which in this case is an unrivalled beast of a premium flagship phone ;)

It not that much great!!
","
The phone is good but not the best. Battery life is average just getting 5hours screen on time even though I have kept the screen resolution to HD and power savings mode ""ON"".The main negative I found is heating issue, just by browsing, checking WhatsApp, Insta the phone is getting hot, that is so pathetic. Camera is good, zoom feature is ok, don't expert any DSLR clarity with it, to be honest I'm disappointed with the clarity, by seeing the reviews in youtube I expected a super crip image quality, Naaaa.. it's not there. I really dont agree with the NIGHTOGRAPHY of samsung, the phone at all performing well in the less light ambience, it create so much noise in the picture. And yeah, inspite that samsung says it has AI stuff, the picture comes blurry even with slightest movement of the subject.Display is good, it is bright and vivid and super smooth, no complaints with display at all.Sound is decent, keeping the Atmos mode on, really succeed in creating some surround effects.Spen is just take the phone into more productive level. This is one of the key feature I brought this expensive phone.From the past 8 years I'm only using Galaxy note series phone. Anyway the final statement is, Overall it is a good phone but I really don't think it's price worthy. Paid 1.12 lakh for the phone (including watch) it is really not justified this high price tag.Display, camera and sPen are the main catch of this phone, rest all are offered features are included even in phone below 30k price range (including 8Gen 1 chip set)To be honest, not that much satisfied with the phone!

Very poor battery life if you're a heavy user, i have to lower the screen resolution to 1080 for somewhat okish battery life.Also charging speed is crap, i mean we're living in 2022 where brands are providing 80W+ chargers ( that too in the box)Camera, build quality, performance, etc are great.S pen integration is decentAlso keep in mind if you'd be putting a tempered glass then fingerprint sensor WON'T WORK!

A fantastic top tier Smartphone
","
I was in a dilemma before purchasing the S22 Ultra, whether to buy the samsung or to go for the iPhone 13 Pro. I was not a big fan of the Apple's walled Garden approach to their ecosystem and not a big fan of iOS either but during a short period of use i really liked the iPhone 13Pro. But i loved the Android, its flexibility and Samsungs extremely customizable One UI. So i took a leap of faith and pre-ordered the Ultra. And until now from the minute i unboxed this beast of a Phone (the charger situation aside), it never disappointed me. Perfomace is superb, cameras are outstanding, low light performance of the cameras are out of the world. Battery life is more than enough. One UI is beautiful , fluent and buttery smooth. Speakers are fantastic. I did not find any issue of overheating even after heavy sessions of gaming. But the phone gets a little warm. Thats all. Okay...! Now some of the Cons1. I am coming from a OnePlus 6, and when comparing with that phone, this one is heavy.2. Some pre-installed Samsung apps have all the permissions and notifications allowed which we cant change, uninstall or disable.3. When it comes to Video recording, Samsung still cant beat its Notched Rivals. They still outclass the Ultra by a huge margin.4. Another annoying thing. Long press of the power button wakes Bixby up by default. Although we can disable bixby, samsung wont allow us to set it to summon the Google assistant.If samsung keeps its promise of 4 years of major updates and 5 years of security patches for its top end phones, one can use this phone for more that 3 years easily if you have a habbit of holding on to a phone for that long. And i am Super satisfied with my decision to purchase this phone.

Very much a promising package and gives very less scope for disappointment. With this phone in hand, you will desire for less and aspire for doing more with this phone. Definitely will make other phone owners, except for iPhone 13 pro, feel envious.What I feel the best:1. Camera quality, potrait clarity, photography options, photo editing options etc2. Screen quality is outstanding and every image on the screen looks better than it's actual beauty. Very vivid and brishtl3. Haptics is so accurate and adaptive. Feel so good with so much attenction to detail for haptics.4. Strong built and premium Looks5. UI experience is smooth and fluidic, no breaks, no freezing, everything is ultra perfectNot to good:1. Battery - definitely has no enough juice to last move than a day with normal usage(no games or other powerful apps). For heavy users, it may last less than a day. I still feel it on par with other flagship phone (except iPhone) but definitely not a bang for your buck.2. I found it Hard to find a screenguard in market and had to shell out 1k to find a average screen guard.3. Not giving a PowerPoint adaptor. You need spend 1-2 K move for this.Rest all, it's a true flagship phone and a powerhouse in your hands...!

For anyone who wants the complete android experience, and does not mind shelling out a premium for the same, you can't get any better than this. The S22 Ultra is Samsung's answer to the ""Complete Flagship Package"". There maybe phones out there that excel in one area or another, but this mobile is so good at everything, it is hard to compare it to anything out there as a total package. The camera is other wordly, the display is beyond beautiful. Overall, I would highly suggest the S22 Ultra to anyone upgrading from a 3-4 year old device, looking for the complete, premium Android experience.

The camera features are great. Battery life is low during initial days but it improved over time with AI learning about your usage patterns.The screen is a masterpiece.

Don't forget to use a case, atleast a skin in the back. S pen is very helpful and if you don't use it very much, just put it in and forget. But you'll easily find a task in 1 out of 5 days, that you'll be happy that you've this s- pen.Overall great phone.  Better than iphune 13 ProMax

The best phone for photography...

I bought the Phantom Black 512 GB variant of S22 Ultra. I pre-booked the device along with the Watch 4 offer. My net cost after all discounts and offers for the combo was Rs. 1.14 lakhs.RATINGS: OVERALL 9/10Camera: 10/10 (the best photography on a smartphone; for videos however, iPhone 13 Pro would be best though).Software: 9/10Display: 10/10Battery: 8/10Charging speed: 8/10Sound and Haptics: 7/10Performance: 9/10Features: 9/10Call quality: 8/10Heating: 10/10 (didn't see any heating issue with my limited use so far; haven't played games yet)Ultrasonic Fingerprint Scanner: 10/10 (it is impressively fast and accurate)Face Unlock: 9/10 (it is superfast in well lit environments, but doesn't work in dark environments)Here's my review after 2 days of use:CONS1. This is a 2 handed phone. It is big and you'll be uncomfortable using it with one hand. I wish the phone was slightly narrower and came with a grippy sandstone case.2. No pre-installed screen protector. I don't think you'll find a perfectly fitting screen protector either due to the curved edges.3. Battery life is just okay. I get about 5 to 6 hours SOT on a full charge.4. Charging speed is just okay. I bought the Samsung 45W Travel adapter and it takes about 1.5 hours to fully charge the device. This is pretty slow compared to what we see with OnePlus/ Xiaomi/ Oppo/ Vivo phones.5. No charger or earphones in the box. Only the phone and a Charging cable (tpye C to type C) is provided.6. Phantom White in 512 GB is not available in India (only 256 GB is available). I wanted it, but had to settle with the Black option. Some reviewers say that the Black variant gets scratched easily for some reason, so keep that in mind.7. OneUI doesn't use Material You theme of Android 12 in it's full glory. Some people may like it, some would prefer the stock Android feel as seen on Pixel and Motorola devices. It's not bad though, but just not a refreshing change. So putting it in CONS section.8. Status bar icons are not too customizable.9. Curved Display: This has no practical use. They only look good on marketing materials. When you are actually using the phone, there is absolutely no benefit. On the contrary, content gets bent at the edges and not great especially when watching videos or photos.PROS1. The best camera on a smartphone for photography. For videos however, iPhone 13 Pro is best. I bought this phone primarily for 2 reasons: the cameras, and the S-Pen which comes with it's own housing.2. S-Pen: Only phone with the pen feature.3. The best Display on a smartphone. I have kept the default FHD+ resolution (120 Hz adaptive refresh rate) just because there is hardly any difference you'll notice between FHD+ and WQHD+ on a small screen, and also because there is hardly any content that is of such high resolution. So I switched back to the default setting to prolong battery life.4. Feature rich software: This has both plus and minus points. Minus because more and more features means more chance of bugs and device slowing down due to bloatware. It also consumes battery. On the positive side, you can do a lot of things, although much of it is fancy, non-essential stuff.5. One handed use option (software feature) is very nice.6. Switching between light and dark themes is very smooth along with adaptive pallette selection.7. Phone has built-in call recording feature (atleast in India) without the stupid voice announcement.8. Performance is very good. No heating issues or throttling so far.9. This is the first time that Samsung has brought the Snapdragon chip model to India. Based on reviews, it is better than the Exynos variant just as in previous years.10. Both Face Unlock and under display ultrasonic Fingerprint scanner are SUPERFAST. Although in dark environments, face unlock struggles to unlock the phone. Using the Fingerprint is better in dark environments.I got two cases: Spigen Thin Fit and Caseology Parallex (a Spigen sub-brand). They fit perfectly, without adding bulk to the device.I haven't found a screen protector yet that would fit perfectly without bubbles at the edges.So that sums up my experience with the phone over 2 days of use. Hope this helps you with your choice of smartphone.EDIT: I had pre-booked the device on the 5th of March and it was delivered to me on the 17th of March, even though deliveries began on the 12th itself. My complaint is w.r.t the fact that the exact same variant was available with 1 day delivery to my pincode starting from the 12th. So anyone who ordered between 11th to 15th would have received their delivery within a day, earlier than me. This is unfair because seller has to service orders on a first-come-first-served basis. I can't accept someone ordering upto 10 days after me to get his order before me.But I will keep this in mind next time I want to pre-book on Amazon. When I enquired about it, customer service told me that I got it at a discount. That's a terrible explanation because there was no indication of that when I pre-booked the device. The offline stores were offering pretty much the same deal. Had I gone with an offline purchase, i would have got it much earlier for the same price, plus I need not have worried about the product getting damaged during transit. I mean I can inspect the box and make a decision before purchase at an offline store. The box I received had a few minor damages, although everything inside was fine.Expect delays in deliveries if you pre-book an item on Amazon, even if the item is in stock and available for delivery to your pincode by the same seller.

Beyond expectations. A true flagship. Samsung has finally nailed it.
","
Pre-Ordered it on 3rd March 2022.Received it as promised on 11th March alongwith the Galaxy Watch 4, 44mm.Had been using the One Plus flagships since 2017.Initially , I was skeptical about Samsung devices due to the bloatware and other issues.However, I decided to take the leap to this device after much deliberation and narrowed doewn to the iPhone 13 pro max and S22 Ultra.I already have the Tab S7Fe and am very happy with the performance.Coming to the smartphone, the device received was the phantom black 12gb ram,256 gb variant.Amazing finish and build quality.I found it to be a bit heavy and bulky initially,  but after a while, got used to it.It is a large device and not advisable for people with small hands.I would like to break up my review in two parts.Pros and Cons.Pros:1. Amazing performance from the SD 8Gen1 chipset.No lags or glitches whatsoever. A true flagship with industry leading processing power. The RAM plus feature is good.2. Amazing battery life. - some people will complain about mediocre battery life. But I have had no issues so far. The battery needs to optimise the apps. And after about 1 week of use and 2 updates later, the battery performance has improved. Getting almost 2 days of battery life with the 120hz adaptive mode and QHD+ resolution always on.3. Stunning display.-Samsung has always been the unbeaten champion of display tech and has once again nailed it with this QHD+ display.The colour reproduction and accuracy is immaculate and precise. The superbright screen is easily readable in direct sunlight and no screen bleeding or inconsistent color observed.The adaptive brightness works flawlessly.4. Virtual RAM works wonders. The already adequate 12 gb of ram is complemented by the virtual ram feature and is a boon for multi tasking and gaming.5. S-Pen features. I have always been a die-hard fan of the S-pen and have craved to use a flagship device having the feature for my daily work and gaming use. The S-pen is very useful in jotting down notes,as a magnifier, as a doodle, as a selfie stick and adds to the convenience.6.Super versatile camera performance.The camera performance is absolutely spot on.Be it point and shoot, portrait mode ,selfie, video recording, pro-mode or the slow motion shooting,Bring it on. The versatility offered is unbelievable. Apple needs to upgrade from the 12 mp hardware and learn to deliver better hardware in lieu of tweaking the image post capture like Samsung. Details captured and the stunning portraits are proof of Samsung image processing with optimised hardware and software experience.7. Valie for money and bang for your buck.I pre ordered the S22 Ultra and the Galaxy Watch4, 44mm and got a very good deal on Amazon for ₹.1.08 lakhs.Had I opted for the apple ecosystem,  the total cost would have gone up to ₹.1.50 lakhs.The Galaxy ecosystem is evolving and the level of customisation is wat better than iOS ecosystem, although there is a huge scope of improvement.8. Samsung updates: I was concerned about the android updates as Samsung was notorious for non-updation of their old flagships. However, I was relieved to find out that Samsung has promised 4 years of updates. So that is a real peace of mind. And my device has already received 2 software ,firmware and security patch updates via OTA.Cons:1. One UI. The most irritating part is Non availability of Google voice assistant. Everytime I try to use the voice assistant,  the Bixby routine assistant is prompted. Samsung must go ahead and drop it's Bixby assistant which is not as optimised and versatile as Google assistant.2. Curved screen. In a way the screen is immaculate and accidental touches are avoided if we switch on the accidental touch option. But curved screens are a headache and prone to accidental touches. I so miss the flat screen on my One Plus 7T.3. App drawer horizontal navigation.The app drawer just cannot be modified to scroll vertically. I downloaded the good lock app and the home up drawer customisation is not up to the mark. Samsung needs to optimise this.4. The Galaxy app store needs to be synchronized with Google Play store so that unnecessary pop-ups and useless apps are not recommended.5. Heavy animations consume battery life and need to be disabled manually.6. Option of 4k video @30fps needs to be enabled manually.All said and done, I am fully satisfied with my purchase and I must thank Samsung for making this amazing device as a combination of the note and s series and also kudos to Amazon for facilitating my purchase.Thanks and regards.

Excellent phone if you want a pen and a good camera!

IntroductionThe Samsung S22 Ultra is a Galaxy Note and as such, looks like a Note. In fact it's a more than perfect Note. It does everything a Note would do and even has a recessed pen! A Note person's wildest dream come true. In addition, unlike most Notes, this one has one of the best cameras you'll find in any flagship phone and great features.StylingWhile the looks... shape, proportions, colours etc are subjective, the edges are not pretty. Nor are the sharp corners. The edges could have been chrome or brushed steel. Instead, they are a glossy version of the colour, that looks painted and cheap. There is no camera bump, which some may like but it looks naked and cost effective to me. Also, the camera edges are dust traps. Once in a case, this looks more than fine but at that price, one could expect a better finish. The pen has been allowed to dictate the shape... curved sides and flat at the top and bottom. And the resultant sharp edges where they meet.PerformanceThe S22 Ultra is fast and smooth too, but It gets very hot with use. Not warm, hot! The S21 looks much better and doubles as a Note too. This one is not really a successor so the name is a mystery. Or is it just Samsung killing two birds with one stone?At it's core is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 which powers every 2022 flagship available in India right now. While it is fast, it does get hot with use which is not ideal, especially when you need to put it to your ear! Cooling this one is no small task and Samsung haven't managed to do it for sure. The case could keep your hand cool but the screen gets very hot too.The Camera is where it really scores over almost every other Android phone. It's better than all I've seen except the Pixel but it has a a wider ultrawide (slightly distorted) and macro focusing too. There's a pretty amazing sensor, a very powerful 10X Zoom lens and great camera software. The S22U tends to over sharpen images but this could be fixed later with the right software update yet it may not. The way it is now may be more popular, as at present, it's an excellent click and post. There is shadow noise but only if you zoom in.The Pen doubles as a remote shutter release (and can even control other camera functions like a magic wand!) which is very cool for Pros / tripod photos and selfies and group shots! I could take a selfie with the rear cameras by remote trigger! Likewise a group shot and not be limited to the selfie cam. It has a good range.ConclusionIf you want a premium Note with a pen, well look no further, this is as good as that gets. The recessed pen makes the display broader but that's absolutely fine... it even has it's advantages. The pixel pitch is imperceptibly less but 16:9 fills the screen better than the longer / wider format.The price obviously includes the pen which makes it more bearable. As of now, at their showrooms, Samsung are offering their Watch 4 (MRP ₹29K) at ₹3000 with the phone which is a great offer. If however, you don't need a watch, then it's expensive, at ₹105,000. If you can wait, when sales slow down, you will get it for ₹92K. (If you look hard enough, even now.) At ₹92K, it's a very good buy, it's features are cutting edge!The S22 Ultra is the best Note till date with an excellent camera to boot. If you like the looks, the shape and the metallic finish, just buy it already. It's fully worth the premium price. Never forget, Samsung are counting on the fact that the iPhone 13 Pro Max costs a lot more!_

This Smartphone  is everything you'll  ever need a great camera a great display great performance  and clean android experience.The one mark this missed is battery if you use this for performance  then expect below average battery.But if you use it normally it will last a whole day easily.Maybe a future update can fix this But buy this thinking that this would give less battery than most Smartphone  available.

I have been an android user for as long as I can remember.And in all my previous phones one thing was different from this one.They were all budget friendly high end phones, the likes of one plus and such!And I have to say the experience I had with those so called flagship killers does not even compare to the awesomeness that is this phone!My only issue is with the battery life which is average.Otherwise all in all a great phone for experienced android users and novice alike.

Excellent build quality. Finally Samsung has outdone themselves. Snappy phone. The S pen makes so many things faster. Had no trouble switching from my S20 with the smart switch app. Lasts the whole day with about 3 hours of gaming. Samsung should have retained the micro sd card slot though.

Hope my review will help many to take right decisions.I was a long term Samsung fan boy since Galaxy 1I have used Galaxy S2 , Galaxy S5 and then Galaxy S5 and I gave up on Samsung because of the SoC they used to ship in India which was very underperforming and overheating king - The Exynos SoCI switched to OnePlus but lately found OnePlus stopped caring and listening to it's community.I bought Apple iPhone 12 mini no doubt it was an amazing device but had very short lived battery which was expected but battery life worsened after 9 months of usage.I finally decided to check in to Samsung after looking at various reviews on YouTube I finally thought to give it a try and boy I must say it's worth it.Below are few highlights which I love the most.Camera : Hands down the best Camera. It captures immense details and has handful features.Portrait images are just breathtaking.Performance: Well this was the most concerning factor and boy oh boy what a relief the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 does an amazing job without a doubt and I've been testing this device since a week now and I've put it through a lot of high performance stage such as playing YouTube videos for 1-2 hrs followed by browsing on internet using Instagram and playing COD for 45 mins and I must say it did last easily 5-6  hrs SOT

Coming form Oneplus devices for the last 5 years, S22 ultra is truly a 5 star experience. Everything about this phone feels premium. There are so many settings and customization options that I am yet to discover them all. Plus I got the Watch-4 for almost nothing.....one extra star for that.Initially the phone will heat up a bit during charging and battery would seem like discharging within no time. Just give some time, let the phone learn your habits and suddenly everything will start falling in place.

The phone is a beast no questions asked. It worth the every penny you spend. Everything is above the scale:- fast, Snappy.Design is what stood out the most for me though its not much of a difference from it predeccssor still its feels out of the box to hold.Performance is as it should be, best in the game, With Snapdragon 8 gen 1 processor there is alot of a talk about heating however there is no such case with this phone. No matter how heavy user you are or how intense gaming you do this phone handles it all with a ease.Camera:- When i purchased this phone i was really looking forward to experience the camera it offers, If you compare this with best in market iphone 13 pro max, then you wont be disappointed, it offers similar camera quality or in some conditions even better. The dynamic range, saturation, portrait shots all are excellenet in day light. Its nightography function is also extremely good. Talking about video capabilities it offers 8k at 30fps and all other similar in market, its VDIS and OIS feature does make your video rich, steady with prefect light balance. Just like its predecssor this also offers superzoom 100x But all i can add is till 30x its perfectly good after that samsung needs to work on it. Perhaps in next 4-5 years we might be able to have 100x as clear as 30x zoom feature.S Pen:- latency has been reduced to 2.8s which is the super best i can say and also the air gestures is quite fun to use and you can do quite alot with your spen like signing your pdf document on your phone itself without worrying about to get a copy and then signing it.  Using S pen also gets the premium vibe to you in day to day uses it feels bossy.Battery life:- its Good can be better on day to day heavy uses it gets 7-8 hours of screen on time which i feel is already good but its competitor 13 pro max has much better battery compare to it. That generally offers 10 -11 hours of uses which is insane. I would ask samsung to focus on its battery this will generally lead to out perform even apple.Everything else is the best no competition design, performance, One UI, camera, S pen and display. This is phone of the year

Overall it's a great phone to have. Excellent screen and camera quality. Many of the camera categories it won Over iPhone 13 pro max. UI is clean . Finger print sensor fast but one in 10 times it will fail. Battery size is big but it's performance is not upto the mark. I kept all display settings high and I am using phone now more since it is a new one and I have to charge it morning once and evening once. It may come one full day with regular usage in future for me. That is not great for 5000 mah Battery but I can live with that considering how great the display is. And buy phone using without offer option only so you get it around 93k. With offer option is a joke. Just do the math you will know how silly with offer option is. Overall happy to have this phone.

Firstly, coming from iPhone, I found camera to be way too superior compared to iPhone.  Especially when it comes to zooming clicks.When it comes to ease of use, it's good overall. But OS smoothness is not that good compared to OnePlus's Oxygen OS. Apps download and installation takes a lot of time when compared to iPhone and OnePlus.There have been several events where I found apps close down automatically when you start using them. Maybe a software update might help on this. There have been events where the phone has lagged as well.Earlier I had OnePlus 7T Pro 2 years back and that phone was damn smooth and never did it lag at all not did any of the apps crashed u like Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.These were few instances where this phone has disappointed me quite a bit. All these issues can be resolved via software update. So hoping Samsung team might look into it and do the needful.Design is stunning and so is the S Pen.This phone has great aesthetics of how a super phone design should be. Now my mom uses my OnePlus 7T Pro phone and occasionally when I use it, it's too fast even being on Android 11. So, come on Samsung and fix the bugs. We have put so much of trust and money in this phone so we deserve the best experience from the phone of such a name.Rest, I will update my review after I get an OS update to see if the bugs are removed.Thanks!

Ultra phone at ultra price! Worth it though 👌🏻

I have been using the phone since 10+ days now, and it's been a fantastic experience. This is my first S series phone, that also comes with S-Pen so first Note series as well 😀.Performance:It's buttery smooth as expected from a flagship phone. RAM is pretty much occupied by system but I didn't found any issue while day to day use, and ain't a heavy user as well so can't comment about gaming performance.Battery: it doesn't feel like 5000 mah. Need to charge every morning, sometimes before sleeping at night. Hope Samsung fix it by software update.Camera:Tuning of camera is done very accurately by Samsung. Color levels, exposure, HDR..everything feels perfect. Zoom is extraordinary and perfectly usable till 30x-50x. Still haven't got opportunity for testing the camera in different environments, will update later for that.Accessories:I have applied Spigen screen protector on screen so fingerprint reader is working same as on naked screen, and S-Pen is also working fine I would say (Not smooth as on glass, but perfectly usable).Spigen Liquid Air cover is just perfect to hold the S22 ultra, as it provides extra grip on the sides.Even though it's costlier, I would recommend to buy who has budget for this ULTRA flagship. You will just love it!! 😍

Everything about this phone is excellent except the speaker volume and the finger print sensor when using a screen guard.

Okay, 3 Months user review is here. Lets go directly on the pros and cons.Pros -1. Ultimate curved beautiful design.2. Camera quality is unbeatable, beating iPhone here.3. S-Pen of course (The best feature however there is no much use of it, but good to have it)4. Software is good and smooth with many loaded features5. No Heating problem at all6. Unbeatable performance7. Jumbo battery with good backup8. Zoom - Ultimately Unbeatable zoom features (Upto 100x, just wow)9. Jumbo internal memory, no need to external memory card.10. 12 GB RAM is providing awesome experience.11. Latest powerfully processor12. Power sharing is one of the best features.13. Wireless charging is a cool feature. However it is not easy to handle. Cable charging option is better than this.14. Touch response is good.15. Better than iPhoneCons:1. Heavy design, you can not control it by one hand, could be better, sleek and light weight.2. Extra big screen, Samsung should provide such feature and design in small screen,  5-6 inches.3. Face reader - not beating iPhone, iPhone has super speedy and accurate face reader even in the night. So I am disappointed on this point.4. Horrible Finger print scanner - Too bad experience with it. Even oppo, vivo phone worth rs 20000 are having far far better finger print reading than this phone. So I decided to use pin lock only.5. No charger or earphones in the box, This is really a worst part of these costly phones. I hate it.6. I miss auto power off/on feature in this device. I love that feature to make the phone cool.7. If Samsung provide a date time, location and static text timestamp on the images captured by the camera, that would be a cool feature.8. Phone and features does not justify RS. 1,00,000 . Too much costly.Overall, this is a beautiful, Strong, Fast, Smooth, features loaded phone. I recommend it if you are fade up from iPhone. Not for general users. Business use mobile.Review after 2 Months -Cutting one star from the rating because it heats too much if you take many pictures and says its too hot you can not take more pictures. Then I had to put it in front of my car's ac vents to cool it for 15 minutes. So I missed valuable moment capture in that time by this phone. Luckily I was having iPhone too. And Samsung is claiming they put extras heating protection in it. It is not beating iPhone on that point. iPhone doesn't not heat even after heavy use.

Pros:-1. Display (Best display you can get at this price i.e.  Super Amoled with 90Hz Refresh Rate2. 🔋 Battery (6000 mAh big battery)3. Camera ( 64 mp) and selfie (20 mp) and if you  know you know samsung image processing  software.4. Looks and back Design ( Awesome Pattern with  rainbow 🌈 reflection.)5. Compact Size (6.4inches) not too big and not  too small.......handy..Cons:-1. Processor (mediatek helio g80) which is a low  end processor and it might not affect your  overall performance if you are not a heavy  gamer or something like that.2. Infinity U display. Nowadays drop notch display  is kinda outdated look since overall look of the  phone is great but this small thing is like a black  spot on a white chart paper.##But Also keep that in Mind how can you get  everything in just 14999 -17999 ........in mid  range...these specs are perfect and at last you  can trust the brand name too.😏

A useless review

I am sure there will be many reviewers who will do an in-depth analysis and list out the pros and cons of the device. So here i am pointing out the negatives that i felt . First thing first, the ring volume is mediocre. Ring is not at all loud and i wondee whether I have recieved a faulty device.Second thing i loathe is that, the back cover is a fingerprint magnet. Some kind of resin or composite material is used.To be honest, i didn't like the phone much. The design is outdated and sub par a 10k phone. Since bought this for an elderly person, the ring volume was a total bummer for me. Thats it, another useless review from me.

## OVERALL PERFECT PHONE 📱📱
","
Pros:-1. Display (Best display you can get at this price i.e.  Super Amoled with 90Hz Refresh Rate2. 🔋 Battery (6000 mAh big battery)3. Camera ( 64 mp) and selfie (20 mp) and if you  know you know samsung image processing  software.4. Looks and back Design ( Awesome Pattern with  rainbow 🌈 reflection.)5. Compact Size (6.4inches) not too big and not  too small.......handy..Cons:-1. Processor (mediatek helio g80) which is a low  end processor and it might not affect your  overall performance if you are not a heavy  gamer or something like that.2. Infinity U display. Nowadays drop notch display  is kinda outdated look since overall look of the  phone is great but this small thing is like a black  spot on a white chart paper.##But Also keep that in Mind how can you get  everything in just 14999 -17999 ........in mid  range...these specs are perfect and at last you  can trust the brand name too.😏

This phones support 25w charger but only 15w charger is provided so there must be 25w charger in the box

A useless review

I am sure there will be many reviewers who will do an in-depth analysis and list out the pros and cons of the device. So here i am pointing out the negatives that i felt . First thing first, the ring volume is mediocre. Ring is not at all loud and i wondee whether I have recieved a faulty device.Second thing i loathe is that, the back cover is a fingerprint magnet. Some kind of resin or composite material is used.To be honest, i didn't like the phone much. The design is outdated and sub par a 10k phone. Since bought this for an elderly person, the ring volume was a total bummer for me. Thats it, another useless review from me.

First Samsung phone
","
I'm a just a basic user of phones.  No movies, no games.  I mainly use phone, messages, photos, chats and other social apps and some utilities.  For the price, the features seem impressive and for my mild usage this phone sounds great.What I did not like is the amount of apps that were already installed on the phone!  Then I had to un-select a whole bunch of ""recommended"" apps during setup.  I was pre-subscribed to 'diagnostics' and 'recommendation' and 'marketing' notification by default!  Is that allowed?  Some features don't work unless I use specific apps.  Basically, they are app features and not phone features.  Sounds 'grey-area' to me.After spending half a day to go through all the settings and clean up the mess I think I'm ready to use this phone.  I still wonder what else I missed...

Feels like butter, great for everyone except hard-core gamers. Great overall experience offered.
","
Amazing phone. I would rank it the best overall phone experience. The pros are obviously known to everyone, the 90hz display is great. The touch feel is literally like butter. Cameras are great. Amazon prime runs in HD so widewine l1 is there. Speakers are loud, not tinny but lack bass. Can't complain.Phone requires careful first time setup to avoid ads as suggested by ranjit sir. No ads encountered yet. Everything works well, side mounted power button /finger print reader is fast and accurate. Light sensor, proximity sensor are flawless. These 2 are typically bad in Chinese phones (mi note 5 pro user) causing display to turn on when in call, so thumbs up.The cons: the processor seemed weak on paper, but the experience is great. Not that I am defending samsung, but a compromise 90% can blindly make. I do not play games, so can't say much but better processor phones out there. This is for general public who wants smooth experience of samsung phone and no software bugs.Some complained of emmc5 storage, but apps installed damn fast and I did not find and sluggish read write speed issue. Fast and phone did not heat during setup process when installing 100s of apps and no slowness observed. I have 2 m30s in house, they also pointed out better build quality, better looks of my black version and fluidity of screen. Good for light gaming. Go ahead with the phone for good vibes throughout phones life. Now samsung is giving 3 years of software updates, so great.

Should be of 9k or less.Others opinions may differ from me. This is just my personal experience.I'm sorry to give you less stars Samsung but please improve your quality not quantity. There is no mandate to launch new phone every week.

Pros: Screen resolution is good. Speed and performance is ok ok. Sometimes got little sluggy during parallel execution. Camera is very good quality. Battery life is good. SW is really smooth. Speaker is louder enough. Finally it's not a Chinese brand.Cons: No 4k or HDR video viewing. So some videos are blurry even though it is HD. During charging phone gets heated up. Tats may be it has bigger battery. 5G support is not Der since most phones are now with 5G. Price might have been little less to compete Chinese brands.

After purchasing Samsung M12, was looking forward to getting M31, but the mobile was not available and the prices increased. After waiting for a month, saw that M32 is available so purchased it but not entirely happy with it. The phone rings on its own at times, chimes continuously other times without any call or notification being given. Phone lags at time and opening apps also takes time. Perhaps the 6gb variant is better but I have 4gb model. OneUI was supposed to be stable and I am quite disappointed with this particular purchase at least.

Great display, great camera but comes with a couple of catches
","
From my usage over a month and taking it to a trip where network reception was absent 90% of the time, my reviews are this:-Display is great, surely compares to flagship devices, the sAMOLED Infinity-U display is really something else, bright, brilliant, vibrant and with the 90Hz refresh rate (laggy animations appear sometimes), quite responsive too. It is miles ahead from smartphones in this range.-Camera is pretty nice actually and surprised me a bit, especially from budget Samsung line, however, it does have a habit of oversaturation in some minuscule scenarios, low-light photography is average, just average as can be expected from phones of this range.-Battery is AVERAGE at best, please keep this in mind before buying, don't let the 6000mah figure fool you, for powering a display of that much calibre the battery lasts a day to a day and half depending on usage but NOT more than that in any case. The 15w charger provided requires a good 2-2.5 hours to charge up the 6000mah battery. 90hz display is a battery drainer, so I set mine on 60hz for the trip, for office/home scenario where frequent charging is not an issue 90hz is great albeit laggy animations appear sometimes.-Back panel is polymer based and is prone to fingerprints, smudges and scratches, so a light case is the right way to go.-Network reception is great for both WiFi and cellular and does not suffer from the low signal issues faced by some M31 users, etc. Bluetooth works well too.-Fingerprint sensor is snappy but coming from a phone where it was present on the back, it takes time getting used to and is sometimes just a tad bit slow, nothing to worry about.-External speaker volume is bad to average, it is not at all loud, I am not criticising this, maybe a lot a of people prefer quiet phone speakers but it is sometimes hard to hear ringtone or notification sounds especially from a phone where notification LED is absent.-Always on Display is present but reduces the battery percentage 1-2% at most.Summing up the above, overall, great viewing experience, camera is alright, battery is average, speakers are disappointing.-STRICTLY NOT a performance beast by any means, great for everyday or business usage. NOT for gaming.-Have not observed heating issue as of yet.Hope this helps, Cheers!

In-depth detailed Review ↓
","
Writing this review after almost a month of using the product.First off, I want to emphasize that the value for the product is just great.Build Quality:The body & screen are toughened and have a premium feel. The ""rainbow"" reflective back seems a bit weird to me, I would rather prefer a plain, smooth finish but that's just my personal opinion.Camera:Okay, this is probably the biggest topic to discuss on. Camera quality does not depend on the megapixels, it depends on the processing engine of the device. Megapixels are only useful for zooming in. So whether you have a 64MP phone, or a 108MP phone, the pixels don't matter. The processing engine matters (which is why the iPhone 11 with just 12MP shoots way better photos).The camera is mediocre, neither too good nor too bad. It does have a night-mode which is pretty decent. If you are into professional photography, you're better off with the Oneplus Hasselblad or the iPhone.But if you just take photos casually to post on social media, it does its job pretty well.Size & ease-of-usage:One can be a bit skeptical when using a device that is sized more than 6 inches. However, Samsung absolutely nailed the ease of use with the inbuilt scroll gesture on the power button. The power button is sort of like a laptop's touchpad, when you swipe down on the button, it will open the notification tray from where you can get access to your WiFi controls, etc. To close the menu you just have to swipe up on the power button. This is a really unique & useful idea because when you can use only one hand, it is uncomfortable to scroll through the top of the screen, but this gesture makes it super easy!Processor & Performance:Being a previous Snapdragon user, I was skeptical about moving onto the Mediatek family of processors. But given the size of RAM & storage, this device is perfect for semi-competitive gaming. Of course, you cannot expect it to perform like the Asus ROG Phone series, but you can get around 45-60fps at high graphic settings on AAA titles, which is pretty good. The 90Hz screen is fantastic too, and the gameplay experience is smooth & fluid.Screen:Not much to say here, it performs as expected. The 90Hz sAMOLED display is crisp & smooth. You also have an option to switch to 60Hz refresh rate to save battery.Battery:Just super! You can easily go for 3 days without a charge if you're not a frequent user. Medium gaming for 1 hour consumes around 6-8% battery. But if you just use it for messaging/calling/checking mails and casual gaming, the 6000mAH will easily last you for 2-3 days.Final verdict:I think that Samsung has done a really good job with the price range here. The phone offers plenty of features, which, as compared to the price are justified. If you're looking for a device around the 15k price range, go for it!

Great phone for the price, but certain things disappoint
","
First the good things:1. Audio is loud enough & Dolby Atmos works excellent with earphones / speakers.2. Display is crisp & is clear even outdoors.3. Front Camera is good, the photos come out clear even in dim indoor light.4. Mobile doesn't hang or crash unlike previous Samsung mobiles.5. Mobile isn't too heavy & feels just right in the hand.6. Camera is great outdoors & has a number of options including Pro mode & a very decent macro mode.7. Good battery backup. Lasts a day for normal use & videos. Display is amazingly clear & the phone speakers are loud enough to be heard all over the house.Now for the not so great part:1. What's with the sheer cheap plastic sim tray? The tray broke instantly while trying to install the sim. Had to spend Rs. 800 for a new one & this was on the day the mobile arrived.2. The touch lags. It's a very obvious lag & it takes a nudge or two for the mobile to respond.3. The Camera zoom is an utter waste. Don't even bother zooming at 10x.4. Comes preinstalled with a lot of useless apps & can't remove half of them.6. 3GB of 6GB RAM is always taken. For what?4. The finger printer scanner is at the most bizarre place. It's at the right hand side, bang in the middle where it doubles as the power button. It's real crazy to use & doesn't recognize fingerprints easily.5. Charger adapter provided is not 15W, but 10W. Takes about 2 hours to charge.6. No screen protector, no ear phones, no back cover. Samsung is really saving up on the small essentials.Should you buy this phone? Sure! Go ahead & buy if it's a regular everyday usage phone you're looking for. It looks premium, it looks stylish, & with all the features you want.

HANGSUNG - Horrible Phone
","
HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !The phone hanged multiple times during initial setup process, there are very visible jitters and lags while even navigating the UI.Please note this phone does NOT have UFS storage since it comes with EMMC 5.1 which is comparatively slow, also the G80 processor is poorly optimized for the device.The OneUI have some bloatwares and lots of useless apps from samsung, it also push these useless apps via OTA updates so make sure that you uninstall the apps only after you do the OTA update or else it will appear once again after the update.The only pro that I could say is that the display is decent and bright, the speakers also sound pretty decent at max volume.I would suggest you to go for Narzo 30 or Redmi Note 10s or the poco X3/M3 pro or even Realme 8 at this price range.

I have to say this phone is just fantastic. Cameea quality is superb.

There are also other various modes in the camera section.BGMI :- Good Graphics, but recommended to play non HD, even tho it supports HD.Overall Gaming :- Very good for mediun gaming.

The only good thing this phone has is camera quality and display. Battery is ok. 6000 mah is big so can last one whole day. It's processing speed is nothing. Working speed and when more apps are open it gets real slow. I have the same ram 4 gb in my 2 and a half year old MI Y2and that phone is a lot better than this. For basic games it's slow so forget the big games. Overall this phone is nothing if you can buy same segment MI. I'm regretting my decision.

I had to change my old phone because it was starting to be a pain. I wanted to wait and buy a bit more priced phone. At first glance i thought it is good for the price. But its performance worth 40-50k. Its super fast, good storage,camera Quality is also good. Biometric scan is good. The screen quality is off the charts because its 90hz and 1080p display. You wont be able to use any other phone after using this. The battery life is good, i used it for 3 days without charging and its fast charging takes Almost 2 hours to full charge from 0-100%. I have been using it for almost a month and really enjoyed it. My old phone was Samsung Galaxy J7 NXT. It lasted 6+ years without any problems. If you are thinking that phones at this price aren't worth buying then you are wrong, because i thought it too. Its amazing phone.

Poor camera, bloatware & frequent crashes

I've used only samsung smartphones for past 10 yrs and avoided Chinese sets. But while the Chinese phones have matured up with time, Samsung has gone downwind.While this phone is decent to look at, it's camera is a total turndown: pictures as well as the camera software - both are like 6000/- phone. Processor is so slow, it takes several seconds to display image thumbnails sometimes. Further, it has got innumerable bloatware that you cannot uninstall or disable. The UI crashes or hangs too often. Paid 12k for this slow, 64GB device while many others offer better processors and 128 gb storage at this price. Regret buying it, totally.

Best for parents. Below Average for young generation

Review after 3 weeks of usage:The processor is clearly NOT up to the mark despite having a 6GB of RAM to play with. It is slow and it feels lagging and takes a second to open stuffs. Perhaps, an Exynos could have done wonders under 6GB RAM. Surely, not for gaming and for young generation in general who would want things to be speedy and quick! The camera quality is average for its class.""BUT"" - I bought it for my mother. And the SAMSUNG M32 is EXCELLENT for her usage.The brilliant S-AMOLED Display is a treat to look at. My mother watches YT videos, Insta Reels for fun and usually stays busy on WhatsApp Video calls and social media - FB and others. And this is where this phone excels with its crisp display and long battery life.So, I'm satisfied with this purchase. I would any day choose a finely tuned Samsung S-AMOLED over Chinese half-baked AMOLED/TFT/ FHD displays. Plus, it comes with 6 months free Screen Replacement warrenty  - you know, just in case.Decide yourself what you really need from this phone and whom are you buying this for?I hope my review helps with your decision.

Very erratic software issue even after repeated updates
","
I had a samsung M31 which rarely gave me any issues, so I automatically opted for M32 when it was time for a new phone. The new M32 software is making me want to never invest in a Samsung phone again.There is a huge issue with the accidental touch protection feature which Samsung is failing to acknowledge.  If you have done the mistake of choosing to switch on this feature, the notification for the accidental touch protection turns on and it keeps flashing it continuously and does not let you cancel it, or log in or even turn off the phone. It makes the phone unusable for a lot of time till you push a lot of buttons, do plenty of trial and error and somehow get the phone to restart or switch off somehow.  This is a show stopper and is absolutely unacceptable for a brand new phone.This is of course in addition to pushing a whole bunch of Samsung software which are absolutely unneeded.  This version is also way bulkier than M31. The camera etc is good but no other feature is usable if your phone itself becomes unusable so it doesn't matter.

I bought this phone as secondary phone so features hardly matter to me, however if someone is planning to buy this as primary phone then my suggestion that you opt for 6gb Ram coz the only drawback I have witnessed is that phone is little slow in response , mind it I'm saying slow that doesn't mean it hangs as I'm using 4gb ram so I advise 6gb ram for primary user. The best part of the phone is Display and Battery and trust me when it comes to display even 30k Chinese phones can't compete to samsung display. I'm long time Samsung user since 2015 and currently using s20 plus have tried I phone , one plus 8 pro but no one can beat samsung in their gorgeous SAmoled screen

Looks a great phone for ₹15749. Galaxy A32 has almost same specs but is around₹5k more.However the seller has put wrong and misleading product information.

The phone is good, got it for 13.5k during the December sale with a bank offer.Took a long to dispatch, but finally got it.Upon opening, I was disappointed to see dust particles around the front and back of the phone, and also the inner battery compartment was torn, maybe during shipping someone would have thrown on that side hardly IDK.Installed the screen protector right when I got it, while preparing the screen identified two scratches. Not sure whether I got a used one or not, but since I needed a phone badly accepted it.Would have given 5 stars cutting 2 because of the experience. Maybe they need to pack such fragile things properly and don’t send returned ones (not sure about this but how come dust can come inside?).

Build quality is average( it has plastic back but considering the price it's ok but still it could have been a bit better)2. Slow charging ( Samsung says it supports upto 25W charging but provides a 10W charger.. Imagine how long does it take for a 10W charger to charge a massive 6000mah battery?)3. Plastic back is fingerprint magnet( it easily gets fingerprint marks)4.

It's 6000 mah battery don't last even 15 hours of normal usage and cherry on the top its battery takes 3:30 hours to charge from 5-100%.

Review of normal daily use.Pros:- Good display- Good battery backup - atleast 2 days- Good speed - no lag- Good call clarity- Fast fingerprint scan, can add upto 3 fingers- Call recording without announcement- Adaptive eye comfort shieldCons:- Presence of bloatwares (unwanted preinstalled apps)- Speaker is not loud- No backcase providedOverall it is a good phone to have. Weight of pros are above cons. If you are not a heavy gamer, just ignore low processor & emmc comments from others. They are just tech things which doesn't matter in daytoday use. Lag and ram usage reported from others is also probably due to unwanted apps. Unistall/disable them will solve the problem. Uninstall only after initial setup is done and after installing available phone update. Otherwise they will be forcefully installed again. After setup also it will try to install through Galaxy store. But it is under control if first setup done correctly ('geekyranjit M32' in youtube).Reduced 1 star only as a warning for Samsung to exclude bloatwares in upcoming models. Also they should not force to use Galaxy appstore.New Mi and Oppo models also have more bloatwares and additionally they have call recording announcement (other party will know that call is being recorded). In comparison, my recommendation is to consider M32. If you need a phone only for normal usage, then 4GB 64GB variant is enough.

A great budget phone
","
The M32 is a great budget device that is capable of handling everyday activities. The best things about this phone are the presence of the 3.5 mm headphone jack and expandable storage. The cameras, fingerprint reader and S-Amoled display with the 90Hz refresh are excellent. However, battery life is rather poor, and the 6000 mAh battery seems like 4000 mAh, and drains quickly. Also, even though the phone runs on One UI 3.1, Samsung has throttled a lot of the features on this device, which is very disappointing. The MediaTek processor is subpar and the phone occasionally stutters. Do not expect flagship level performances from this device - however, it will get the job done if you're on the lookout for a budget phone.

Although it is not a 5g phone, but i am pretty much satisfied with overall price to performance ratio.I am not a gamer so i cant comment on the gaming performance of this phone.My father use it only for watching youtube videos, whatsapp and for phone calls (obvious).It has a 90 hz display and it is a very good display and i cant feel any difference from  a 120hz display phone.In a normal day to day usage l, it performs excellent with no lag or hang or whatso ever.However i cant comment on performance based cpu demanding task on this phone because i do my perforformance based based work flow on pc.This phone has inbuilt call recording feature which no other company is giving now a days.Till now there is no over heating issue in this phone.I also bought m52 5g in 26000, and i regret my decision considering poor price to performance ratio.I feel i would have bought the m32 4g for my self and could have saved 14000 rupees easily.Both phone run pretty smoothly and similarly except display size and camera placementOverall m32 is a good value for money.Considering 5g is not present, in real world, in fact is not a big deal, because when 5g will be available after 1 or 2 years, your current 5g phone will also become older at that time.So better to save money and invest later when 5g will be available on ground, because as at that time you will get much better price to performance ratio.

I had redmi 6 Pro and exchanged it for Redmi 11.But I'm not impressed with the phone.Display looks normal and I don't think its better than Redmi 6 pro. I still feel Redmi 6 pro screen is best.Camera is really a avg one. Not worth it.Prev Redmi phones were really good, camera quality too will be goodThis one doesn't fit in to Redmi family. Though it has good specifications, it doesn't worth.Fast charger is good, charges really fast.If you just need a phone you can go for this phone... more review after a week.Review after couple of weeks - March 8 2022.Display - Doesnt look like AMOLED display. For me its like a ordinary one.Battery: It charges really fast and it can withstand for a day.Use: I nvr did gaming on this phone. Just using for call & whatsapp. Sometime, screen flashes and some app crashes. Happens atleast once or twice a day. call quality is good. Though I've 6GB RAM, it nvr behaves it has 6GB of RAM.This phone can be used for ppl, who need a phone wiht big display and battery.camera is really bad. Don't know why Redmi is doing like this. Pictures looks normal outside with good sunlight. Under tubelight, could see more noises in picture. Not at all happy with camera.

Good for daily tasks
","
Bought this phone since my old phone was giving me network related troubles and also the processor was not powerful enough to handle latest apps. This phone is excellent to do regular tasks like social media apps, browsing, youtube, online study etc. Processor is capable enough to handle normal tasks related to our day to day affairs.It has UFS 2.2 storage feature which makes app opening snappier. Initially I wanted to go with Moto G31 but this phone easily beats G31 in value for money department. My only concern with this phone was the ads/crapware in MiUi but surprisingly Xiaomi has manage to reduce it a lot and if you carefully disable the relevant options within the MiUi, you will not get any ads.Regarding Camera, it has average camera quality. Nothing impressive but this was expected in the price range and I'm ok with it cause I'm not a selfie shooter. I have my own DSLR which I use for any special kind of photography. Video is not that great. Its OK for one time viewing or for sharing on social media.Processor is OK. It can handle most regular daily tasks without any issues. Occasional hiccups are expected but they are understandable in terms of price-performance ratio. What surprised me is that my Mom's Redmi Note 5 has Snapdragon 625 processor which has 4K video recording but this one doesn't despite it being superior to 625 processor. It would be great if Xiaomi can enable at least 1080p/60fps in the next update.Phone has all the important sensors like gyroscope, compass etc. Many times in this prices range, gyro or compass sensor is absent which are important sensors. I use Google maps a lot for navigation so Compass comes handy to know my direction.Screen is excellent. Its on Par with 20-25K phone range. 90hz is smooth. Sunlight visibility in outdoor is great. My old phone had IPS panel which was excellent but sunlight visibility was very poor. This is just brilliant. Content watching is immersive. Also its not too big either like 6.7 inches phone which are cumbersome to carry in pants. This one is sleek looking.Battery is above average tbh. Xiaomi needs to do better optimization in this phone. Though it has 5000mah battery but optimization is poor which eats away battery even while doing normal tasks. It can survive the whole day but Xiaomi needs to think about it in the battery department. 33w fast charger is game changer. It charges phone fairly quickly. So, that balances out the optimization issue to a bit. Kudos to Xiaomi for providing ""real fast charger"" instead of supplying 15w charger and calling it ""Fast charger"".Water/Dust resistance is essential.It has Dedicated slot for SD card which is also a plus point which going for this phone. Other phones in this category have hybrid solutions or no expansion slot.Side Mounted physical fingerprint sensor works great. This is what I prefer instead of in-display optical finger print scanners.Carrier Aggregation is there. Dual 4G standby works great. I can use Vodafone 4G while JIO sim stays active. Call quality is great. Dual Speakers provide adequate loudness and speaker quality are excellent.Overall this phone serves my needs. You can weigh your requirements with pros/cons and decide it. There won't be a perfect phone in this price range but this one ticked all my requirements. Thank you Xiaomi. You sure know how to make affordable and value for money smartphones for Indian consumers.

I was using redmi note 5 and now upgraded to this phone.It's AMOLED display is awesome😍😍😍. Its the best thing in this phone.. And also good battery backup. 20-24 hrs with moderate use..Starburst white colour is superb😍😍😍. I loved it.Decent Rear camera U will love it.Front camera is ok better than redmi note 5 but not compare this with 20k or 30k phone cameras. Video quality is average.At this price it is good.Good performance. No lag issues. 90Hz refresh rate is nice. Finger print sensor is working fine.Bright Torch light. Light weight.. Easy to use in one hand.. Comfortable design. First  day I experience a delay in charging and I thought it doesn't have fast charging at all. And also there was huge heat issue during charging.Second day that problem is almost solved.. Heating problem reduced and charging also become faster.. And  4th day onwards normal heat issue only and charging become faster.Auto call recording is not there.

Redmi Note 11 review :: Camera Quality is not upto the Mark.
","
Advantages::* UI Display looks good.Disadvantages::* Mainly camera/video quality is not satisfied. company informed 50MP.. but pixel clarity less than 16MP.. The reason is 50MP is not default in camera view.  everytime, we have to select 50MP option.. Also no zoom option for 50MP view.. Completely unworthy cameras compare to samsung/Realme(sony camera).* When Playing game also phone got hanged frequently...* Morning you charged in , end of the day is getting completely drained..* 2 speakers sounds are little lower than other phones..* Too many advertisements.. its keep on advertising on every navigations..so, its budget phones.. targetting all middle peoples with Ads. so MI company will get more beneficial from you,. AND YOU WILL NOT BE GETTING BENEFICIAL., YOU WILL BE SEEING SO MANY ADS LIKE YOUTUBE,.Before buying, Think twice.. if you need Good quality camera/video phones, just Blindly go for Other brands like Samsung/Realme & lQOO..If you don't bother camera quality, focusing on good display & surfing YouTube & browser, you can opt this..

Though writing a review only using it for 4 days is too early, but there are few things need to be shared:Display: Excellent Display. Build quality is also good.Battery & Charging: Good battery life (24 to 36 hrs in moderate usage) & fast charging.Audio: Decent audio quality with dual speakersCamera: Good camera in daylight conditions, images are sharp & detailed... though under low light it's a bit grainy but still detailed (again other mobiles in this range also has similar problems, their softwares in order to lose the grains makes the picture soft)Video: Video is not upto the mark. It's very shaky. Must have some issues with the stabilizer.Gaming: Gaming with high graphics & for long hours is not recommended. Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 is not a heavy gaming processor(However I was playing SFA for 2-3 hours with low graphics quality & its performing fine)Heating: Till date no heating issues.

Redmi phones quality is going down with each updated model. E.g. my Note 8 has much better camera quality than my new Note 11.Further the speakers at full volume may permanently damage them (again low quality).Perhaps this is going to be my last Redmi product as I will switch to a better quality brand after 3 years (once Redmi permanently makes my phone non operational through software upgrades as it happened in two previous phones 3S Prime and Note 7).

Just don't buy it.I will update my review if any changes are observed in future.Comparing this to my 2 years old realme x2Pros - The only pro is dual speakersCons:-1. Build is inferior to realme x2.2. YouTube only supports 1080 while my earlier device supported 2160.3. Audio codec support on bluetooth ji device is SBC while my previous device supported AAC.4. Earpiece audio quality is not good too.5. Camera quality in front as well as back is not as good as my previous device.It felt like a downgrade from my previous device which had the same price and better processorI was hoping it to be having a good build like Redmi note 10 unfortunately it doesn't, currently very disappointed from Mi.There is not a option to return this product, only damaged products can be returned so I am stuck with it. Amazon should show a pop up regarding such important matters and should not hide it in some corner.Was a satisfied prime user until now but now I am questioning my choices.

Performance gets sluggish after taking calls(normal call, whatsapp call) due to CPU throttling.I have even observed CPU frequency getting stuck at 690Mhz and never coming up (Enable Developer options -> Power monitor -> Monitor Frame rate)This is a SERIOUS bug and root cause of all performance issues being faced by multiple users of RedmiNote11. In fact I am reviewing my 2nd unit after exchanging 1st unit due to performance issues.Check the attached pic how Geekbench scores vary based on which time benchmark was taken.Before the call, all good scores above 380. Post taking calls, it become 170!

1. You can't enable an Always-on display for the whole time. It will be shown only after 10 sec you turn off the screen2. Notification Sound setting is not available I can't believe you can't turn off notification sound separately in 2022 this feature is available in 2015 smartphones it is combined with ringtone sound you have to silent your whole phone If You don't want notification sound definitely Then you are going to miss the calls then because vibration is not strong during ringing but in other cases typing taping vibration fell very strong3. Focus mode is a joke In this phone you will still get notification from focus mode itself if someone Texted you on WhatsApp or any other app send you a notification it will not show from which app it's coming but it's still annoying What the point of focus mode if I am getting notification from focus mode itself4. BIG PRIVACY ISSUE - there is an app called security app I don't know why smartphones need this kind of app in 2022 what's the point of a smartphone anyway this app takes your all permission all means all location, camera, call logs, file & storage everything but you can't disable it and can't uninstall it

Worst Phone ever. 😞

Bought this phone at 16k and wasted my Money.1. Camera:Front camera is worst camera ever in any phone under even 10k  13MP Camera looks like 1.3MP VGA camera that comes in 1k Feature Chinese phones while video calls even if you use Fiber 100mbps or 1gbps connection.Back camera is 50MP but in Indoor it's like old 5MP in Only work good in Sunlight and outdoor good lighting conditions otherwise don't expect much it's badest 50MP camera.Max resolution for video recording is only 1080p 30fps ..... old Realme 6 can record 1080p 60fps 4k 30fps  and compare the price of both. This Redmi Note 11 Even doesn't support 1080p 60fps Only 30fps is max option in this why it have an new processor if old one is powerful. This phone is completely Downgrade on any phone you currently have right now. Even from 2017 ....2. Performance:  As per the specs on paper it mentioned SD 680 in it and it's poor processor and even MediaTek G85 works better than this shit.It take longer time to capture and preview picture in galley after we take a photo in camera. And phone even didn't support Some apps properly Like vidmate kinemaster and few other apps it just automatically close apps after sometime while using and kinemaster just open only 1st time 2nd it start crashing and that was not app issue it's phone issue itself.3. Software:  Only one thing i want to say is Now i figured out why it called a MeMe Ui ........Lags a lot. Hangs like 10 years old phone.4. Display: Yeah Good but 60hz looks like 30hz and 90hz looks like 60hz so No reason to spend Money for 90hz screen .....  Buy any other good phone with 60hz it will be lot better than this 90hz .....5. Battery:I haven't used phone much because of these issues so i wanted to Return and Get Refund buy amazon Rejected .....  Battery maybe a good in this phone but for how ""long""So, My opinion on this phone is if you get it under 10k than ok but if you you can use it  with those issues i have mentined above otherwise not worth to buy...""Say No To This Phone"" Don't waste Your Money on This Device it will not work properly. And can't satisfy and Normal User.For camera Users Don't buy it .... If you use camera in Low Light conditions than Don't waste your money on this phone better to buy Any other phone but not This.Do Not Buy this 👎

 Received this phone with scratch on screen. May be it is manufacturing defect. After raising replacement request they have assigned mobile inspection service and the the provider did not meet the appointment date and time. He is not even picking up my call.After replacement still there are lot of issues are there in this phone. Camera app is not working properly even quality is not good grains are coming after photo captured.It is waste of time again and again I have to call customer service. It is not pathetic.

Not worth for this Money

Nothing special in this phone. Not worth for the price tag. It should be 10k. Weight is less. That's it. Front camera is very very very worst. Taking pic is different, auto beautify is different. So the end result is very worst image. Even if u turnoff beautify it won't. I am a Normal user. Battery drain very fast even u r not use. Max 1 day it will come. But the only good thing is it took 1-1.15 hours for charging. Thank God.. Don't think much about 5G. Even 4G is not getting properly other than metropolitan. So that's ok. If u want any phone u can go for this. Don't expect much.. Thankyou

Lags every now and then

There are too many bugs and glitches in this device. It lags every now and then. There have been two system updates sience i bought this device and none of them fixed the problem. Dialer is one of the biggest problems because every time i open the dialer there is at least 3 sec. Lag. Its very frustating. Camera quality is not very good. And heating problem is also there. So if yoh are are a very light user (you dont use too many apps) and dont click too many picture and you don't get frustated by 3 sec lag of dialer ever single time you want to call somebody then you can go for it. Otherwise dont.

Must have

I purchased it for my father. It's great, working smoothly and what else would we need. I mean it's a normal phone with better display and carrier aggregation. However, let's not set the expectations so high. If you are buying the phone for camera, you can go for high end Samsung, Apple or even OnePlus device that will cost you 40k + for a decent phone from those companies. But buying this phone and complaining that camera is not on par with DSLR is something hilarious. For my father, it's a great phone. Display is the primary highlight.

It is an average performance device and at some part it performs below average.Pros:-Dual speakers.-90 hz Amoled display-50mp camera- miui 13 (android 11) out of the box.- 1gb more memory extension in 4gb ram device- quite light phone.- battery Is best.Cons :- Processor : it makes the phone perform similar to redmi cheaper ₹7000-₹9000 phones.- Display : Avg quality amoled display although the brightness is very good it does not feel as crisp as my note 10 pro also you can't play HDR videos on it and no 4k video support.- Audio : no Dolby Atmos support and those who use note 10 pro knows how much it affects the sound (i.e. takes it from avg to good quality loudspeaker experience)- Camera : it says 50mp and shots do come out quite good but that is during sufficient lighting only and image quality takes a huge toll in slightly poor lighting conditions.I bought it for my mother and for her the YouTube Facebook and Instagram work fine audio is sufficiently loud.Also remember to buy the insurance at least for screen damage as it is amoled display and could cost you high during repairs.

RN 11 is a good phone at 12499, the display is superb. Battery backup is very good thanks to 6nm processor. The speakers are clear and loud.The biggest letdown were cameras, the sensor produces average pics in daylight. It doesn't support 60fps , or EIS . Also the device doesn't feel snappy, it stutters while switching to apps .Conclusion - Good phone if you are content consumer , don't even consider this if camera & gaming are your 1st priorities.

This is my 6th phone from MI/Redmi Series.I have seen many phones before buying this. Finally selected this one bcz it meets all that I wanted.1. I need an IR blaster. (other than MI phones I did not find this great feature)2. Audio/Video for calls and its quality/call recording (Excellent)3. Smooth/bright/sunlight/outdoor display (Excellent)4. Dual Speaker (top and bottom) and sound clarity is one of the best ( Excellent)5. 6GB/128GB + 33W charger + 90hrz ( best  in this price range)6. Comfort in hand and also in the pocket.+ The camera quality is enough for me, satisfied with this price range.+ I charge once and use it all day. A one-time charge is enough for a FULL DAY..+ No heating problem.Got everything I need and gave it 5 stars, totally satisfied.It seems MI knows what Indians want, coming up with good low budget phones and trying to giveas best possible features are possible in that price range.Huff...never understand how someone buys an Apple phone for 70,000+ rupees or even more.TIP: We should not use an always-on display and animations and a high refresh rate to keep the batteryhealthy for all day.Amazon delivered in 6hr. and got a 1000 rupees discount with CC. Completely satisfied. Thank you.

The 6Gb Ram version is quick and works well on daily tasks, Ram management is good, the only flaws I saw is a boatload of junk per installed in the phone and Wi-Fi seems to be a bit weak as it keeps disconnecting frequently on moving around. But works well on 2.4 ghz. I Bought this for my mother and it works pretty well and 90hz screen refresh rate is also amazing,auto brightness although does not work really well specifically in dark mode the brightness becomes too low.Update: Wi-Fi issue Still Persists even after changing all the suggested option.

Not that great! Fingerprint sensor on the right side of the phone is the biggest disappointment out of all! Just a light touch will open it plus the location of the sensor is the most common place to touch. Secondly, the notifications are completely useless I can never pickup a call on time because it keeps on disappearing whenever I try to click, same goes for reminders and alarms. Also, the back of the phone gets easily scratched. If you're buying it on budget then it's okay but if you want a good smartphone with great technology this phone is not it!

Pros1)Amoled Display, Great for multimedia watching.2) Supports Carrier Aggregation i.e 4G+ singals3) IP 53 Rating.. no worries of phone damage due to rain, splash of water.4) Stereo speakers are loud and clear, no distortion even at highest volume. Balance between speakers is off but still considering price no complaints5) Widevine L1 certified, Can watch Full HD Content on streaming services6) Future Android Updates to Android 12 and 13, security updates till Jan 20257) IR Blaster.. Use phone to control electronic appliances such as TV, DTH Set top Box, ACs etc8) UFS 2.2 storage.. much faster than eMMC storage used by many mid range devices.9) Excellent battery life, easily lasts whole day and two days if usage is light10) 33 watt fast charging, charges phone in 1 hour 15 minutes.11) Brightness is good even under direct sunlight.12) No heating issues, some phones get warm even during calls.13) It supports Alexa Hands free.. really useful while driving.14) Fingerprint reader, Face unlock works well15) No issues in call qualityCons.Cons are mostly software based and can be fixed via update.1) Auto Brightness issue.Phone brightness increase automatically under sunlight but in darker situations the brightness stays low andi have to manually increase brightness.2) I Have 6 GB ram model and even then some background apps are closed by the system.3) Always on display feature is only for 10 seconds.4) Cameras are average (OK for basic use)// I do not game on phones so can't comment on gaming performance. In regular use phone is fast// For Ads free experience watch youtube videos ( I have not seen single ad on my device till now)// For people living in metro cities consider buying 5g phone. Rural areas can buy this one as 5g will take some timeVerdict:- Best all rounder phone in budget with minor software bugs which i expect to be resolved considering this phone will get android 12 and 13..

This is a good phone at 13k and better than Samsung phones under 20k.Camera is quite good. The uwa camera is 8 mp which is decent. Added photos of uwa,wa and 2x zoom. Clearly better than previous Samsung M21 I had. And does not kill the images by oversharpening like Samsung did.Pro mode allows full control. camera2api fully supported (level 3). Overall 5/5 for cam.Calling and network seems ok. SAR 0.85 which is better than many other phonesAudio 5/5 - has stereo speakers with some bass and quite loud, 3.5mm jack and sound through headphones is excellent.Battery lasts more than 2 days for me as I only do calls, use camera sometimes and listen to music. The 5000 mah battery somehow lasts longer than the 6000 one in Samsung.Comes with all sensors and fm radio.MIUI 13 - liking it so far. Coming from one ui 3.1 and stock Android before that, my opinion is that they were clean and simple but lack some useful features. MIUI is more customizable and useful.No heating or lagging issues so far but I dont play games, so cant comment on that.Overall complete package with 33w charger and back silicon case screen protector, unlike recent Samsung phones which removed charger and put a usb c to usb c cable so that some people are still forced to buy chargers.Also no 5G which is good for price reduction. By the time 5G gets available properly the prices will reduce.

Average!

I didn't like it! I had used redmi note 8 pro previously, so It's display got damaged and I bought this, this is not good, made for people like our parents and grandparents! It doesn't support HDR videos playback, no 60fps recording at 1080p, the camera has good focus control in video recording but lot of frame drops at high quality and over sharpening! The camera captures true to life colours in well lit conditions but very soft image looks blurry and not at all close to sharp..! Single flash, 90hz doesn't make much difference It's still useless! Phone feels stuttering! No ram management! No split screen, no good gaming! Good stereo speakers available, super tight headphone jack (you may end up damaging your earphones), the camera is like samsung camera, it's very white, cartoonish, blunt images (need stable hands), the pro mode had lots of settings, ulta wide is bad, macro is super ultra garbage useless!!!, Front is not good at all just for name sake it's there, good case and in hand feel, super slow unlocks with biometrics, fast charging is good, enhanced cooling doesn't work heating issues observable, battery backup not good, for so much efficiency, the battery backup is very poor, the phone is very useless and not value for money, it has more cons than pros!After a month of use! I even thought of testing it with an actual samsung phone.. in that case I had my dad's Samsung galaxy j6 4gb varient. I was shook!!! The 6 year old much smaller device performed better! Although it had a bit higher saturation... But it produced better contrast for almost everytime against redmi note 11 and also the biggest shocking result was the difference between human faces! The redmi's output was blunt and soft and even everywhere while an American face looked completely wheatish - white on the redmi, the same face on Samsung had more details about the pale spots on the face, the redness, the pink, (the overall contrast on the image display was so much impressive on Samsung! Even though redmi uses a samsung panel, the GPU on this phone is garbage!!!Do not consider!!!

Good points:1. Screen is good quality with 90hz refresh rate.2. Dual speaker set is good for multimedia and phone calls3. Battery life is good for calls and browsing4. Charging is really fast5. Build quality is really good. Weight is not much. So good to carry around6. Lots of themes and fonts and customisationBad points:1. Processor is not good for any types of games. Even very old processor do better than this1.5. Cpu and Ram are not good. Phone is slow to react. For e.g. when opening phone book after a while, gets stuck and takes time to refresh. Same with all apps.2. All camera are very poor quality3. Too much google bloatware. Google trying to take over your life4. Security issues.  IPhone and samsung are way better5. Redmi not giving Android 12 which has come on even budget phones nowOverall, can buy if browsing, phone and casual video calling are main uses. A BIG NO for camera and games purpose.

According to my usage pattern, I'm not a gamer. This is so far my experience with this handset:Pros:1. Everyday tasks run smooth since it support 90HZ refresh rate.2. The AMOLED looks good not the best color accuracy though.3. Great battery life. 33W charger charges the phone in 1-1.15 hrs.4. 6nm SD 680 Processor dissipates less heat.5. Less weight + Small screen size = Great in hand feel.6. Good haptics. Stereo speakers (Incorrectly balanced).7. Great custom rom support if you hate MIUI.Cons:1. Below average cameras (Front+back).2. Lags and jitters in the UI.3. Ads everywhere (Enabled by default). Lots of bloatware (Can be uninstalled).4. Poor software update cycle.5. Underperforms in gaming (PUBG+COD).6. Occasional proximity sensor issues.7. Adaptive brightness is very bad.Overall a good device for the price I got. But definitely not reliable for long term use unless you can flash custom ROMs..

Major problem is at incoming call.. screen wont switch off even if power button is pressed.All mobiles i have used screen will turn off as soon as power button is pressed if we dont want to take incomming call...but this mobile screen will be always on and it will accidentally accept the incoming call if its inside pocket ... very bad ..2. Camera quality is bad..and  50mp camera is not recognized by apps like doc scanner apps it will be only activated inside stock camera app..And doc scanner apps only see 8mp camera as primary scanner to take photos..very bad...3. Heating issues .. i thought that being snapdragon chip heating will be negligible ..but we can feel the heat .. same as samsung mobiles ..4. This mobile is using AI proximity sensor..it like a virtual device ..real hardware is not present..may be this is causing incomming call screen problem...i am switching back to my old mobile and wait for some updates before using it .. very bad..Redmi is releasing mobiles without proper testing..

The phone is good (I've 6+64 Black one). MI has increased the power efficiency, display quality, and camera from the older version keeping in mind the way it'd do wonders for business work although as expected the processor is on a downside.It'd have been awesome if a glass back was there and sd695 would've been fitted but 14.5k is a fair price for the released product no doubt but upgrading it from RN4 was a big loss for me personally.Issues:1. The left speaker (on the top) is producing a lower sound as compared to the right one (below). Balancing it in the setting would do the job but please update it in the next software upgrade.2. GPS location is not getting accurate. It's about 200m-1000m inaccurate. (Thinking about replacing it).

I'm writing this review after one month of usage. Got it at sale for 13k.Pros:- Good 90hz Amoled screen at this price. One the cheapest Amoled phone.Well that's it.Cons:- Terrible camera. (Yes, I know I can't expect a pro like camera at this price point) but both the the cameras are literal piece of trash. They pixelate the videos. Photo quality is below 7-8k price phones. My 2016 budget Lenovo phone (14k) clicks 10 times better photos and 20 times better selfie. And 100 times better videos. (No exaggeration). If you are going to buy it, then buy it thinking it's a camera-less phone.Other details:- Virtual RAM is mentioned 2gb on 6gb ram phone but I got only 1gb VRAM.Loaded with bloatware. But it's acceptable as it's a budget phone. Weight is pretty heavy. Processor is not that good but considering the price point. It's okay.

After using it for  more than 1 month-Camera: I installed Gcam and it captured very well details and colors. Really Gcam does a miracle. You will also get 60fps video recording option in Gcam.  And it also improves video stabilization. Videos comes good in day light.Performance: I am not a heavy gamer. So it's very good for daily tasks and doesn't hang often.Battery: It's a boss. I get more than 12 hrs of backup instead of heavy usage. I watch videos, use social media and for study purpose. And the charger is really fast it will charge 90 % in 50 minutes. After that it will take 15 -20 min for remaining 10 % charging. But it sometimes charges slowly. I think it's a software issue.FingerPrint: I didn't like it. It is slow and sometimes doesn't unlock ur phone.Speaker: Best in this price range. loud , n crisp sound.Display: you will love the colors while watching movies.Pros: 3 card slot, iR blaster, dual speakers, 90hz amoled display.Cons: no notification light, sometimes slow charging speed, night videos shots not good.

With indoor lighting, it would be a total disaster. Also, the AI option is not available with the front camera.I was excited about the Alex app integration, but it always gets stuck and needs re-install/re-register to make it work.The battery lasts for 12 hours, if you keep it on standby, else it won't.  33W charger is good.The display and dual speaker are okay, but not a wow experience.Even with a 6GB RAM, I don't see any performance difference.

Worst Audio in Bluetooth  and Buggy OS
","
Dear All, I would say, stay away from this phone, asThis phone freezes in between and takes around 20-30 minutes to be normal,I was using Samsung F12 which really have weak processor and slow but never ever freezes.Top of this the bluetooth audio quality is worst, my bluetooths1- realme buds wireless 2 neo and2 - realme buds wireless proare useless now, though it gives good audio on my realme wired earbuds but very low sound on my bluetooth earbudsCamera quality is utterly DisappointingI am feeling cheated

Good Display, Average Phone
","
A moderately priced mid range phone with Amoled display which is probably it's USP.Performance is okay for light users, definitely not suitable for gamers or heavy users.Camera is poor, at par with phones under 10k.Android 11 from the box, haven't received update so far. Hoping to get atleast 2 major updates in the near future.Charging time more than an hour but that's acceptable for the price range and battery size.Will recommend this phone to users who like Amoled display and smooth operation, if camera and gaming/high performance is your priority than this phone is not the best in the range.

Above Average Allrounder Smart Phone
","
I use this phone for 10 days and it performs very well. It's camera is decent in good light conditions, not so good in low light conditions. Camera app is full of features. Battery stands one day easily with gaming. I played BGMI, and it performs very good in BGMI but graphics are only upto balance(medium) and smooth(high) not HD. Display is very good in 90hz and 60hz both. And it's also very bright in sunlight. It's colours are very good. Overall a above average allrounder smart phone. And best phone for medium usage in this range and segment😊.

Worst ever mobile in my life don't buy it

There are many obligations facing with my mobile after the use of 15days,Camera quality is worst first thing,doesn't charge at all,it's taking 8hrs to get charging,Now I'm trying to sell it off but no resale value they are asking for 10000.Worst processors,Its hanging up already, with a phone call and doesn't work as my activities, it works as it needs. Keypad is worst not working properly,  please don't buy MI or real me Xiaomi phones in life , I need a replacement but not able to do it, as it has been passed of a month. Really worst mobiles from these bad companies.I'm selling my phone now itself, There is no response from Redmi if i contacted them also , Please consider this , i lost 4000 in a 15days buy buying this worst mobile ever , I think i had a bad luck to get this type of defective piece .

Doesn't meet expectations.
","
Pros1. Amoled Display with 90Hz Refresh Rate which is quite good.2. Z-Axis Linear Vibration Motor.3. Stereo speakers.4. Good battery Backup with fast charging support.Cons1. 4K videos can be played in Redmi note 4 but Redmi note 11 doesn't support 4K Vidoes.2. Not support LDAC and AAC Audio Codes, but only SBC Codes.3. Noticed that some colors are unbalanced and much saturated while playing videos, and it looks pathetic.4. Average Cameras both Rear and Front, but at this price range, can't expect more.

A product which gave issues rather than features
","
The first week usage was quite normal and there was not a single hint of problems. But with time, I started to notice some bugs which I thought was caused by software issues and could be fixed through an minor update. As days passed the issues got bad such as Delayed call notification,disappearance of call logs,and worst of all sudden blinking of display (""On-Off issue"") that stays for 15-20 minutes whenever happens.Even the quality of the camera doesn't stand upto the mark as the videos I capture seems to contain lots of noise and grains. Also the Ram management and the refresh rate is not quite perfect, it looks like the features were just part of the overhyped marketing and was not actually put in the device as I use it in my everyday life. Therefore I am really disappointed with this device performance and totally irritated by the issues that keeps accelerating as time passes.

Disappointed
","
Review after 10days of usage: I am really disappointed with the camera quality. The primary camera is good under sunlight but the rest are useless.Charging is really fast. The size of the phone makes it easy to grasp. For a person who doesn't play games, the phone is somewhat ok. The phone seems to have a tendency to heat up during video calls.

 recieved my SPARK 8T yesterday, quick reviewCamera is very good specially in low light and selfies.Display is vibrant and bright.It looks very premium.Gaming performance is also nice, did not experience any lag or hanging issue till now.My friends are very impress with this phone.If you are looking for a premium looking all rounder device in limited budget then it is the best option.

Maybe it's too early, but this product has totally delighted me.They're actually breaking all quality standards at this price range!I'm most delighted with the RAM Expansion it's given me. Superb.Now it might be a small thing, but no other Mobile Company has ever done this for me:- The phone came with a pre-installed screen guard and nice plastic security back-cover. Very nice of them, i must say.Now what do I do with the armoured screen guard I had already bought when ordering the mobile??Still, greatly appreciated.Now let's see how the phone behaves over the next few months.

 It is a wonder phone at this price. I just used it for 3 days and almost gone through all the features, just can’t believe it. A made in India product makes me feel proud as well. The battery life, the virtual RAM and the screen quality……to name a few, all are excellent and on par with any phone including IPhone for that matter. I’m using IPhone since 3 years and feel equally better about this phone. Security wise of course not comparable with IPhone. More over the length of the phone is somewhat  appreciative as compared to any phone. However sound quality is not that good but not bad too. Just go for it.

It will loudly says on the call that the phone is getting recorded and the person other side of the call can easily listen that.There are many-many more issues that I can not explain here.

 I have ordered this TECNO Spark 8T phone on the recommendation of one of my friends.I have used it in terms of gaming, photography and found this handset extremely useful in this price range.50 MP camera with 5000 mAh battery is just an added advantage.  Finger print sensor along with Face unlock and 4GB 64GB memory is a complete value for money.Just the colour gives an elite look and gaming is good in the phone.If you are looking for a budget phone with good features your search should end here.

I am writing this review after using Tecno spark 8T for more than 5 months. Phone performance is good in this segment. This mobile provide dual sim of 4g VOLTE connectivity. You can use both sim for 4g volte connection. I like most the seamlessly data network switching function at your need by single tap. Videos runs without flicker and screen quality is good. Little draw back is it's speaker. Doesn't have dolby sound and speaker sound is also not as per expectation. 50mp Camera quality is good and provide good picture qualities.

Outstanding device.The phone design is so premium, but actually it's plastic body. The phone comes with amazing features and great processor in it's price range. In this budget segment I've used Samsung and Realme devices also. But, this Redmi 10 Prime is best among them.The only cons is that the camera is not upto the mark and if you're not regular Redmi phone user then you will have to modify lot of things in this device to make it handy.Edit after 7 months,This phone is lagging too much and have heating issues in summer. I think performance of this device is lowering day by day.

Please must read my review before u buying, now I am using redmi note 10 , I bought note 10 for 14k(6+128), it is great value for money, but redmi 10 prime cost is 12.5k (4+64)  which is very very high price according to its quality of features, front camera captures like 5mp, it is not an 8mp camera, even back camera 50 mp also captures washed out pictures, in the camera department completely utterflap redmi this time, charging time is very long because of battery 6000mah , display is not upto the mark but ok, sound output is good, only main speaker is loud and other is low sound, call quality ok, design good, I had used redmi note 8 before redmi note 10, it is the best value for money under 10k But now redmi 10 prime is not upto the mark for this price, please go to note 10 don't buy redmi 10 prime

So many issues with this model, I have used many mi phones but this is the fist time I have faced so many issues with this model, fist of all about camera, front camera is very poor clarity, 2nd is wifi signal strength receiving is also poor, so many lags in miui 12.5, contact & dailing Google app has so many issues, mi dailing & contact's was very good and user friendly why I don't know that was changed to Google app, I didn't like Google contact app and it has so many issues, and there are so many software issues in 12.5 update also. I am a big fan of mi products & after using this model I changed my mind & want to shift to other company. In that way the phone model has impacted me. Finally I sincere suggestion you don't buy this model if you are using this phone for video calls at least.

Packaging is good.About Redmi 10 Prime:Pros :Good screen size, Primary camera, battery backup as used for 3 days on first charge,body dimensions etcCons:Selfie camera 8 megapixel as in catalogue,but I disappointed in room light ,it gives a dull image. I have Asus Zenfone 3 Max having 5Mp gives a clear photo in selfie 🤳 .  I have a 3 Star 🌟 ating  for the overall Mobile Phone, Fingerprint and Face unlock not set.Will review again after 3 months. Price can be reduced to 13000 for 6 GB 128 GB phone. As I got a feedback that phone is selling at same rate at local mobile shops, then why advertising best year offer..

No much New Features as compared to previous model2. For new mi user it'll be difficult to handle it3. Yellowish Screen Looks irritating and causes eyes painNo Option to remove that yellowish collor on screen apart from turning off reading mode.Update: After Factory Reset it came to Normal Condition.

Redmi should have improved the Camera quality of this prime, couldn't sense 50MP. I have Redmi Note 10 wherein the camera quality(48MP) is class apart. With that perception, ordered this prime10, but somehow disappointing. Battery is 18W which takes time to charge when compared with Redmi Note 10 (33W charging). Would have order Note 10 again, made a wrong decision.Overall, this phone serves as a regular phone for normal usage. Good thing is it has enough storage to save files and photos.

Sometimes any kind of audio and video can't be played in the phone despite of it having full charge and net connection. I have to reboot it and then only it starts to work properly.😑😡3.

It feels if Xiaomi price this phone at Rs. 9,999 (not Rs. 12,499), then camera quality will be considered as acceptable and it will become a great deal for customer.Neutral:1. Overall MIUI works fine. You will not notice any issue.2. Battery backup is good.Final verdict:If you have decided to spend Rs. 12,499, you may also explore Realme Narzo 50 or Redmi Note 10.

Yes it's a budget phone. So the expectations are reasonable. After 2 day use, observed the following. Will be updating the review with more details on continued use.As on 17 Dec 2021:1. Battery backup seems below average for 6000 mAh even after all backgrounds tasks were completed. Feels like 4000-4500 mAh with 90hz on only.2. Display stutters in 90hz mode. Quality as expected from budget device.3. Fingerprint sensor feels slower sometimes fail.4. The phone is thicker than in image and feels heavier, so keep that in mind.5. Camera quality is below average, even though it isn't very cheap, the camera output and video call quality is below average.6. Even though dual speakers, sounds are not quite loud enough, especially during calls. Feels like single speaker quality only.Recommends the Note series of Redmi over this. Will be better value.

I bought Redmi 10 prime 4gb+64gb during the first flash sale, which ended in 3 seconds (or less).Pros:1) delivery took less than 72 hours. Ordered on Tuesday 12 pm and got it around 10am on Friday2) Looks are superb.3) battery life is good. lasts three days. I switch it off in the night and use it a lot for YouTubeCons:1) Feels bulky2) camera quality not good (don't trust the numbers)3) finger print reader is integrated with power button and terrible to use. Phone unlocks and locks again as soon as you press the power button. I am always the frequent use of per button may also affect its longevity. Dedicated finger print reader in my other redmi phones 6 pro, Y3) were very good.4) trash keeps building up fast Overall, this is a good phone for Rs.8-9k. certainly don't buy it at Rs 12.5K. There is nothing worth that much.

Have some patience  and read this fully:-The worst one can do in their lifetime is to buy this phone. I don't understand how this phone is still not banned in the market. I was on WFH and my phone got lost so had to buy this immediately. I did think it would be like every other Redmi note series phone but I made a blunder.The Pros:-Look is stylish and lighter than Redmi Note 9 ProThe cons:-1. Not upto the mark. Screen resolution shows good quality images/videos but can't support HD videos. Imagine playing a MP4 in low resolution in this advance technology era.2. The video will always show you sound first then the character saying their words. I thoughts it's my problem but then I talked to a shopkeeper and he confirmed almost everyone with this phone whosoever visited his shop, claimed the same. Affired!3. Screen light is like a LCD and not like HD+4. Worst image quality- Camera works like a dummy kids phone with 0.05 MP capacity. Worst than any other phone of Redmi/mi.5. The CPU response time is really slow. Trust me, I'm typing it here and it shows up a second letter and this is with every single letter.6. Switching between apps takes longer and lags when you try to open another app while one is already open. It seems like you are using a phone with 200 MB RAM.7. Amazon claims 7 days exchange/Return but when I initiated the return, they arranged someone to check my phone at my home and I'm sure this will not be taken back by them. Another loophole with the customer support system.I'm writing this review after using this phone which has only 3 apps installed so far. It's lagging a lot with just 3 installed apps and rest are pre-installed by Mi.Dear Mi India/Redmi, please stop showing your dumb intelligence to us. Create something worth praising.

Even though it has media tech process in it it runs smoothly, haven't tried game in it so can't say much.Charging : It charges slowly even though it supports 18w fast charging but it charges slowly. Battery is brilliant 6000Mah, can watch movies for hours in it.Camera : It has horrible camera, which captures even more horrible photos. It has 50 megapixel camera but I can say photos are like 8 megapixel. Photos are quite blur and grainy. You should raise your budget little more and buy something else. It's disappointing phone honestly and I'm not satisfied.

Faulty product being shipped as new!!!

Please be aware , I recd a mobile that was not charging and then when mobile inspection team came, they found it was already having a pattern..which indicates this is not a new device. It seems to be a faulty one which was being attempted to be pushed to customer..Very very disgraceful from a company of the stature of Amazon.. Basic quality checks even not being done..even if they say it is the sellers fault..!! Never again will I attempt to buy a mobile from Amazon!!

DO NOT BUY any Android Mobile Phone which doesn't have Qualcomm Processor in it. This one contains 'Mediatek' Processor which is very slow and lagged. My previous Note 7 Pro was working faster and smoother than this. Battery life is good, Camera is okay but performance is worst.Better go for any other model which contains Qualcomm Processor only.

Go for it if you are looking for a high performance, good quality mobile.Don't choose this mobile if you want to post a selfie everyday in social media.* No issues with the Performance, i have installed all the regular day to day usage apps, didn't found any glitch while switching between apps.* Battery is satisfactory, i was expected more but it will give around one and half day runtime with full charge for me.* Camera is not as expected, i didn't expected much from front camera coz it is just 8mp, but i hoped for a good quality from back cam, but i was disappointed with it's clarity, anyway i don't take much photos, and  i convinced myself with the price it is offering.* Design is good, looks stylish, solid and comfortable.* Charging speed is fantastic, it can charge upto 50% with in 30mins.* Speakers are loud enough to vibe for my favorite songs.* mic quality is superbb..* no issues with fingerprint sensor.* face unlock is accurate and fast.* Display quality is good, touch quality is awesome.* Some pre-installed apps are annoying, there is no option for uninstalling them.* one of the main reason for me to choose redmi is it's IR-Blaster, but it disappointed me a lot, my TV is not available in Mi Remote list, i installed some other app from play store for my TV, but it is only receiving signals when mobile is placed straight to the receiver.** Final suggestion: If you are not a Camera lover and looking for a mobile which can work smoothly while multi-tasking, and looking for a decent battery backup in 15k below, then without any second thought go for it.

Overpriced Average Phone

I bought this to replace my 4 year old Redmi Note 4 (3+32gb) which has better display and performance compared to this newly launched Redmi 10 Prime (4+64gb).My 4 year old RN4 display has much better viewing angles and colors compared to its dot display.Even after removing all the bloatware it is using 18gb out of 64gb storage.Phone lags whenever you open any app.Bad camera for indoor use even during daytime.Only good thing is its 6000mah batter but it takes around 2hr 30mins to recharge.Please avoid this overpriced phone.

Camera quality is not appreciatable for this price range, Even a mobile less than 10k can take a better picture then this one... And display brightness is not up to the mark display brightness is just 400nits so the display in outdoor conditions is not quite Viewable... Apart from these two All other thinks like charging speed, capacity and Performance with g80 is like a beast.. If there's a chance to improve quality through OTA then Redmi Should do that for Sure.

Good if bought for ₹11,999
","
Used this phone for a week and here's my initial experience with this phone :> My previous phone was Honor 10 Lite which I bought for ₹7,999 in 2019. Now this Redmi 10 Prime which I bought for ₹11,999 doesn't seem to be a big upgrade.> Display is good and almost same as my previous phone except for the 90Hz display which is kind of useless. Lags a lot while scrolling in Twitter, YouTube, etc. while my Honor doesn't. In 60Hz, it's fine. So for me, 90Hz is just a gimmick.> 6000mAh Battery is too good. Lasts for 2 days without recharging with 9Hours+ SOT. My Honor has a 3400mAh battery and it used to give 6.5hours+ when it was new.Only a small problem, it drains around 3% battery overnight and still misses notifications when I check in the morning, while my Honor doesn't even drain a single percent without missing a single notification. It hardly drains 1% sometimes. But this isn't a big issue. Overall, its battery performance is impressive.> Camera is disappointing. This one has a 50+8+2+2MP camera setup and my Honor has 13+2MP. But they perform almost same. Macro, Ultrawide is useless. UW makes everything grainy. Main camera does well when switched to 50MP mode, otherwise details are same as my Honor. Edge detection is worse than Honor. Takes around 3-4 tries to tap and focus and then it works and still blurs ears and hair. Front camera is fine for the price but the image in viewfinder is too much grainy, it looks like a VGA camera. But after taking picture, it processes and gives far better output. It has an 8MP camera and is on par with my Honor's 24MP camera. If HDR/AI mode isn't turned on, then the selfies are also useless.AI adds too much over sharpening. However I'm impressed by the night mode. It processes and gives a really appealing result.> Software is good. I haven't received any ADs yet. I carefully checked the TnC & unticked AD personalizations. Also, I uninstalled all the bloatwares immediately after opening. Only GetApps isn't getting uninstalled/disabled. I've restricted its background processes, notifications etc and it's not bothering me. I had also heard that MIUI has a lot of bugs, but thank god I've not encountered any yet. Also, I love its animations. They're fluid and pleasing. However lags in third party apps are easily noticeable. I don't play games, so can't comment about it. I can say, My Honor phone at 60Hz is smoother in third party apps than this phone's 90Hz. It gets warm at the top when using Twitter/Disney+ Hotstar/SonyLIV/Prime Video and while playing FHD+ or higher resolution videos on any app which was not an issue on my Honor> Best thing I like about this phone is its dual speakers. It's a pleasure to listen to it. The bass, the treble, the highs and lows are just awesome. It's equally loud as my old LCD TV. After buying this device, I came to know on twitter that this is the only device in that price segment that comes with a balanced stereo speaker.> Network Reception is good. No proximity sensor issue(as many faced in other Xiaomi devices). 4G+ works fine at my location and easily gets 30Mbps+ speed. Though it supports only B40C(2 or 3 other combos are useless like 1C, 3C because Indian operators don't support them yet) , but at least better than many phones which don't even support CA and are prices higher than this. Only problem is BT & Wi-Fi connectivity. It takes about 40-50 seconds to find a hotspot kept next to it, while it only takes 1-2 seconds in my Honor phone. Sometimes, it doesn't even find it and I have to restart Wi-Fi/BT. This is a bug and I hope it's fixed soon. IR remote works with my TV but only On/Off & volume buttons work. Submitted my TV's model number and I hope they'll fix it.Overall, this phone isn't upto my expectations. Neither am I completely satisfied with it. But it's a good phone for the price. Not worth a penny more than ₹12,000. If it came for ₹11,499 or less, then it was completely value for money.Redmi Note 10 was launched around the same price but got a price hike otherwise it was 3 times better option than this.

1. Overheating during charging. (Redmi 8 also had 18w charger, but no heating of this level observed in the last 2 years of usage.) Have booked for replacement. Software updated, Still same issue.2. Battery drain up so fast. While using normal apps, it reduces 5% in 10-20mins. It was told that during startup it would happen. But on 2nd day after updating software also same issues persists.3. While using apps, it suddenly goes to home page4. Slow and lagging. While typing or clicking an app, response time is too slow5. So far NO apps or games installed. Now itself this many issues. Can’t imagine how much trouble it would give later after all apps installed.6. Camera is just on average mark. Too much hype in product details by miTOTALLY DISSATISFIED AND DISAPPOINTED

 Firstly There is no match for the A12bionic chip it can even compete with the new 5g phones  and iphone 11 too but you have to charge it 2 times a day if you are a moderete user then you will definitely feel the battery gives more backup. The XR only has 828 compared to the iPhone XS Max's 2,688-by-1,242 pixel display which means you can't watch 1080p videos if you run it on 1080 it will still show you at 720 but 1080 will be just applied for show. great if you are buying under 34 go for it, phone has lots of good features but some bad ones are no fingerprint unlock ,only 1sim card , 4gphone and lastly the battery backup, they are also fooling indian customers by not giving a chargerPhone camed to me in original state with no deffect and it wasn't refurbished also thankyou darshita electronics and camed fully secured in a secured packageConclusion should not buy in 2022 it's quite old now

The packaging could have been better....it was just a cardboard box inside a plastic bag but the phone's main box was intact. I opened the box and I was so relived to see the phone. It was out of battery so I charged it for about 5 mins till the apple logo came up to the start up screen. I'm currently updating my new phone to the latest os and checking the authenticity (you can check using the IMEI code into https://checkcoverage.apple.com). The phone is in mint condition. It came intact, no dents in the phone nor box, no scratches. Face ID and True Tone works really well too. I must say...getting this phone at almost 50% off was a good deal. On the box, it says 52K but I got this for 34K. And with the frequent annual updates from Apple, I can say this will last me for another 3 years. Anyway, I appreciate this seller for not scamming me. So, yeah, if you want this phone and you are searching for the comment to verify your concerns i hope I have encouraged you to not be afraid and just get this phone if you are wondering if its too much of a risk. (Before giving the delivery guy the OTP, I opened the package checked the phone and verified its there...so yeah..do what you must cause money is money).Stay safe reader.

this is my 1st apple device….i have been using android since 2012…i was little worried that xr dont have back button,gestures that android have & how can i mange…& most important play store… everyone knows that on android platform there are tons of apps & third party apps as well,it has only 720p hd display with single camera how can i manage this in 2022? i must say i was wrong about app store,i was wrong about gestures & back button,i was wrong about display quality & single camera lense as well…if u have tight budget like me & want to buy iphone around 35k then this the best iphone…app store have all the necessary apps,it has 720p display but u will fell in love with this beautiful retina display,single lense camera can be drawback for someone but i am 9 to 5 office going guy i dont give a shit about wide lense & micro lense….i can feel that BMW experience while using this phone😂….only one thing i am missing in software is that app lock for all apps…its just not there…..overall this is great iphone for beginners who wants to enter apple ecosystem…..don’t hesitate just go for it

This is my 3rd iPhone XR. Purchased the previous two from a physical store. The quality of this purchase made online is by far the worst of all the three. It just slipped off my hand ones and the screen and back glass shattered. And tht too within 1-2 mons of purchase whereas my previous 2 phones taken frm a physical store endured far more fatal falls and throws by my 2 year old kid. I feel this seller not selling the right quality good. Never purchase any expensive electronic item from amazon.

But later when I put it on charge I found out the battery was dead. At this price it is beast the battery display sound. Everything is mind blowing. U will not regret for this mobile.

This iPhone XR is 2018 model manufactured in October 2020. Received at battery completely dried condition. The worst part is now Iphones are supplied without charger. Phone package is also not having any damper proof seal. For Rs 33999 is it advisable to buy a 2018 model one year old stock even without a charger, really everyone has to think twice before buying iPhone. I used 6splus already. There is not much difference in IOS 15. Feels solid in hand but front glass is plasticky it’s not a gorilla glass. Display is not Bessel less even above 1 lakh priced iphone13 is not having Bessel less hence no meaning of expecting this from their lower end phones. Its not supporting other fast chargers, but simply its charging. From 75% to 100% with a 33W PD charger it took 1 hour, even there is no indication whether its fast charging or normal charging, also no information how long will take to full charge.  Speakers are just OK loud enough. The best part is face unlock works well even at night. Instead of this for Rs34000/- can go for best Samsung models

I ordered this as a gift for my partner.

My partner is not a specs lover as much as I’m. She care more about the colors and I thought she would love the Coral, 64 gb version (bought it for 34,999). Anyone who is in doubt whether to buy it or not, it’s still a good option in 2021 or even 2022 for those in a budget.

Feels a little bit warmer while charging and that may be due to the fast charging adaptor. The camera is awesome.

I bought this phone a week ago. I bought it now in January 2022. I use my phone basically for social media, light video editing, photography, photo editing, mail, gaming, and media consumption.It works smoothly in all the cases even though this phone was made in 2018.It still feels more premium than other android phones of its range and has a wonderful camera, even with a single main 12mp lens.It’s screen was widely discussed about and it is a controversial topic as the screen is not even full hd, but tbh, if you’re a general user with a normal screen, this screen will look much better and more premium. It only gets defeated by the oled screens out there.Software updates will probably go on till 2024 considering iPhone 6 is losing its support this year. This phone is still on a different level, no denying it.P.S. It’s got an iPhone battery, so ya, it might finish before you want it to, but that’s the case with iPhones.If you want to switch from android to iPhone and don’t want to spend too much, this phone is the best choice.

As an android user for past few years, this was my first ios device.  So far so good. The Ui is really snappy and those who want things to be done quickly and smoothly they should always go for ios(provided they don’t like customisation of their device)Camera quality is by far the best than any android device I have used so far. The face recognition is lighting fast even at low light conditions as they use a special infrared sensor. The only down side is battery which fine for me but might not be the best for a heavy user.I won’t bring out the comparison between ios devices and android devices. It depends on you which one you want to use. Both have their own advantages.And if you ask me if you should buy this phone. That would be a 100% Yes.

So this is my first iPhone since I moved from Android. The interface is different and mildly perplexing but you will get used to it eventually. The camera quality is great- no doubt about that. However my major praise is battery life. I haven’t used the phone for gaming, still I am able to get around 24+ hours of battery life.The major con I will let users shifting from Android know is the transfer of WhatsApp chats from your Android phone to the iPhone. Unfortunately none of your chats can be transferred AtoI. Let’s hope WhatsApp fixes this issue soon. Other that all in all great purchase. Go for it!

Idc about 4k, but as you all know..no 60 fps for 1080p which is a disappointment. Device lagged during multitasking while batt was low. Camera is also pretty average, for the price.

 When I ordered it I got afraid by reading some negative reviews. Here is my 5 days Honest Review with this phone.1) Display - Amazing 9/102) Design - Durable Looks Classy 9/103) Camera - To be honest, it is really good for things photography or product photography, but it is not so good for human photography or videography. 8/104) Battery - Battery and charging is Superb 10/10, works 8-9 hours in continue use.5) Performance - Best for day to day life 10/10You can go for it if camera is not your main focus.6) at this price segment For Good camera there are samsung m52 and a52s available but you have to compromise for battery and charging there.7) So Overall Redmi note 11 pro + 5G is all rounder phone except Camera only. Camera is average...

Highly over priced and performance was not good

Don't buy this phone there is many other good option.I bought this phone first sale,1.Poor performance of devices as you can see antutu score are less.Mi UI not optimised.2. Since Android latest version in market still it's giving this old version simple they want to give less os updates. Dirty technic by redmi.3. Camera rating 0/5 color capturing byoun your imagination.4. Poor battery life not last for 1.5 day fast charging work but look like marketing as device battery consumption High.5. Device price should be around 15k. Bought 20999 too much high.6. MirajBlue colour and overall device experience not premium. It's look like 10k phone user experience.

Not useful for Gaming. Only can be used for videos, movies, browsing and talking phone calls

The features are good,I have observed below issues, while using this phone redmi note 11  pro plus 5g.1) Games: If we receive any phone call, while playing games. The phone geeting hanged and game application was closing automatically.2) Baterry: while talking a phone call for 10-15mins, battery drain 5% and for games 10%3) camera: picture quality was good. More options not used. Using 108mp to capture image, flash light was not coming in night time.4) Reading Mode: Eyes will strain fast and feels like tried.5) Frequently disconnect via Bluetooth with Mi fit watches and car Bluetooth.6) Dual speakers: Hearing the sound will be same as one speakers.7) If you have two sim cards and memory card. You can use only sim1+memory or sim1+sim2.8) No Alexa inbuit. Only google assistant.9) sometimes applications will closed automatically. It will effect mostly for chating, messaging, sending mail etc.Unhappy with his phone 📱

Average.

Basically a 15k-18k phone sold for 21k, sound is surely good and very loud but not loud enough for a device worth 20k+. Miui is buggy as usual, they won't solve simple issues which are plaguing all of their devices(including xiaomi and poco). 67 watt charging might be a gimmick, takes 1 hr for full charge while one plus nord 2 finishes in 30 mins with 4500 mah battery and poco f3 gt takes more or less 45 mins with 5065 mah. Idc about 4k, but as you all know..no 60 fps for 1080p which is a disappointment. Device lagged during multitasking while batt was low. Camera is also pretty average, for the price. Nice display, and the blue model looks great.

Big disappointment from xiomi. I bought this phone for 23k and it does not justify this price.

 + Camera is good. You have the 'pro' section where you can adjust all the settings if you know. Quality is good.+Refresh rate is impressive.+Speakers on both ends+Charging is good but not as fast as 15 mins with the charger. Also, the charger is too heavy to carry along.- I transferred my data from my old phone to this which made the phone quite hot. This creates a doubt om the liquid cooling system.- I experienced some lagging while loading the home screen.Overall, I'm a bit worried about the minus points here for the longer run and with this price range.

I'm describing this phone in some main points--  Fast processor- fingure touch response is fast- Battery backup is great- looks is good- camera is worst in this price range.- phone hanging problem in normal game like candy crush but pubg and cod working smoothly- fast charging is good- youtube videos highest resolution is 1080p- dual speakers are good Overall redmi is selling below 10k price phone in the high rate. Not worth to buy just for a fast charging.Thanks

Had the phone delivered yesterday and what a feeling to hold it in the hand.. Exclusive design with superior screen and display.Started using it since yesterday evening only hence not much to write about. Will update after few weeks of usage.PS: One important thing, this phone contains a hybrid SIM slot, I.e. you can have either two SIMs or one SIM and a Memory card. So those opting for two SIMs and a memory card, must keep this in mind.Hope it helps.Edit: (After around one week of usage)Rear Camera quality is not up to the mark. It seems that there is by default a filter/effect applied on the image. Which doesn't look good.Battery backup is very good. After full day use, there is around 30-40% battery left. 67W charging is ultra fast.Screen display and touch are extremely smooth and give a rich user experience. Double speakers are there but the volume call (with speaker ON) is less.Recording a call intimates the other person that ""the call is being recorded"".Overall satisfied with the phone but a better camera would have been much helpful. Hope it can be resolved through an OTA update.I still have my RedMi Note 8 Pro and it's camera quality is way better than RedMi Note 11 Pro+ 5G. Team RedMi, please look in to this diligently.

I've read so many negative reviews on Amazon about this phone, yet I bought this phone. It's not even a complete day I used this phone still there are obviously cons.1. Speed - While browsing gallery, my files and even basic features like torch - you'll feel the lag. My files takes roughly 30 seconds to open a GB worth of folder.2. Camera - I heard it is not so good but I didn't expect this to be this bad.3. Speaker's quality - Speaker is loud but very noisy.All the above issues are somewhat ok for 10k worth mobile but spending 20k and facing all these issues at 1st day of using it is such a bad thing and I gave one star for that very reason. There are pros but above mentioned 3 are the minimum expectations from a 20k worth phone.Simply, don't waste your money on this.

Blue, Ram/ROM- 8GB+256GBI bought this phone more than 1 week ago and today we received phone at doorstep, after using it for few hours only, I can say, I’m totally satisfied with my purchase. This one is a totally amazing flagship device.The charging on this one is blazing fast. I was skeptical of the 20-25 mins claim but after purchasing, I’m getting 30-35 mins full charge time and that is better than anything else available in the market right now.The 108mp primary camera is just amazing, it gets such nice pictures.There is dual 5g sim slot which supports upto 13 5G bands, so yes, this is going to be a solid future-proof device when it comes to connectivityYou can also record video in all formats which I think is not possible in the majority of smartphones available out there in the market.

I recommend not to purchase this phone get your money get waste. *Also replacement process is very disappointed as they given it to 3rd party*.

First about battery life Awesome. Screen quality its ok and the most about of Camera Quality is the very bad. I think Xiaomi cheated our all customers. It's 108mp camera quality is looks 5mp, 8mp quality. And the front camera same bad quality. And the most important issue is Heating problem. Xiaomi why are you making everyone unnecessary. Pls do work best. I want to my refund.

Pros:1. Good looks2. High speed Charger3. RAM / Speed is good so farCons:1. Camera Quality very poor, even worse than 5MP camera2. Very Heavy mobile3. Voice quality is low, the ear piece sound is very low4. Very less sound in speakers, can't be used for watching movie without ear phone.5. The Finger Sensor could have been made better, by just recognizing finger print, without pressing the button.6. It is sold on Amazon, however the app it contains is Flipkart and not Amazon. Amazon promoting Flipkart now :)More reviews will follow, as this is only one day of usage with this phone.

Review for Redmi note 11 pro 256GbPhone switches off automatically every few hours, sometimes even minutes..not sure why would this happen with a new phone and why the phones are not quality checked before dispatching..Other than that, tested the camera and is definitely it 108mp clarity. I understand it's AI filling up the pixels but it base camera quality itself isn't great.All this would have been perfectly okay in the price range of 12-15k for this phone.

Absolutely ridiculous phone. Camera quality is pathetic. That macro mode is so pathetic didn't capture proper colors at all. This phone doesn't deserve even 10k price tag to be honest.Idk if future updates might solve the camera quality but for now it is so so bad that you would click better pictures with a Nokia phone from 2010 😅 I'm not kidding

Cons :> Bad camera Quality, I would say very bad. You don't want to take atleast one picture also from this phone.> OS lag (This is known defect in this piece). But ok. This is very minor.> Phone is oversized and very big in hand. So difficult to handle in one palm.Pros :> Battery. Its long lasting (this is just initial review after using for a month). Not sure about the durability.> Nothing else in this phone, Not worth of 20K range. better to skip this phone and go for other choice.

Good phone but not the best phone in this price segment.
","
The phone is overall good. The specs are pretty good and the UI is good too. There's very less bloatware compared to older Xiaomi phones.UI - There's seems to be quite a few bugs in the MIUI. The overall experience is good and the bugs can be expected to be corrected in the next update.You can find much detailed review on any YT channel and much more.Points to be noted - During the pandemic time the world has suffered a great CHIP SHORTAGE. So the price is not something unexpected. The tech companies are going through a tough period. On top of that the new chips are aggressively pushing 5G into budget Processors which in turn leads to downgrade in performance of the Processor.About 4k Recording - It's not supported by the Snapdragon 695 SoC so don't expect 4k in this phone.About 1080p 60fps - We can expect this in the future updates, probably Android 12 based MIUI 13.The overall experience of the phone is pretty good. Charging is fast (50 mins to 100%). Display is VERY GOOD (no HDR support, we can also EXPECT this in Android 12 update). Camera is AVERAGE. Gaming is AVERAGE. Battery Backup is pretty good (can last 1.5 days with a single charge and normal usage). RAM Management is good. No issues there.Honestly I'd give a score of 3.75/5. But 3⭐ is too low.

Android 11 is ok ok.Cons:  Battery charge From 15% to 100% it take 4-5 hours.  Shipping was too late it takes 15 days.Dear Amazon,  Kindly include one set of back case and tempered glass.Overall Tecno Pop 5 lte is rock....

Didn't expect much from it and came out as just a good fit for my expectation. Clean UI and sufficiently smooth at per with its configurations except some minor lags and freezes. The horrible part of the phone comes with its customizability and scope of privacy. It comes with a bunch of preloaded and useless apps that you can't even uninstall. And it also downloads ad-funded apps in the background without your consent. I personally feel it's horrible to use a phone that has its free will as if I'm don't at all own it. Thankfully I'll only be using it only to keep my standby SIM going. So not a big deal for me. But anyone who wants to use it as your primary phone rest assured you are gonna hit by a lot of adware attacks.

This was my first switch to an ios device after using an android untill now. And I am not disappointed. The build quality, the responsive touch, the display, the camera, the battery life are just exceptional.Been using for about 10 days now, and consistently giving around 7h of screen on time.The camera is just way too good. Espeecially the night mode impressed me a lot.Only issue when switching from Android to iPhone I encountered was to be not able to restore my whatsapp chats. There are no official/free ways for doing this.The phone is simple amazing.

Device is wonderful but never buy expensive items from Amazon, its better to purchase from Apple store.Delayed delivery by 3 days and on top of it no one in amazon knows where my device was. I have to perform multiple follow ups to enquire about my device and Amazon CSR is worst when it comes to logging a complaint.The final product received is having a dent and Amazon denied servicing and asked to check with Apple, Apple of-course denied since the product is purchased from third party e-commerce website.Lesson learned after 5 days of total frustration and being played as shuttlecock between Amazon and Apple, its better to spend few bucks more and purchase iPhone from Apple rather than typing this review with a dented device.

Smart option compared to pro model

Upgraded for iPhone XR. Battery lasts almost the same as XR but iPhone adapts as per usage over time so it will take time. Which anyways it lasts me for around 1.5 day with normal use and data services and location services always on. Do check the YouTube video to make necessary changes in settings for battery optimisation. Nothing beats the camera performance and let alone the video performance. Phone factor (rectangular edges) feels good to hold however even the MagSafe back cover when put on ruins the fun. Instead try buying a thin screen guard for back of the phone and tempered glass for the front glass as both front and back of the phone seem to be delicate and a costly affair when planning repairs. Overall the performance is great. The backup for Mini is pathetic, buy only if you have very minimal use of the phone. If a telephoto photography doesn’t seem to be on your agenda then this is a smart choice over the pro model.

I used to use an Android phone till 2014 and wanted to switch to iOS, so the same year I bought iPhone 6, It was good to have an iOS device and the performance and the cameras but those were sufficient only until next year when 6s launched. Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but couldn't buy them somehow. I wasn't and I'm not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn't eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I'm quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.When it comes to iPhone 12, it's a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I'm gonna used to of it.I bought a 128 GB device as per my requirement and colour white because finger prints on back are not visible, compared to other darker colours.INR 3000₹ Discount on the colour white, plus 6000₹ HDFC instant discount. Effective price 76000₹. Unfortunately Charging Brick isn't included and it coasted 1900₹ more for 20W USB-C from Apple India website.Overall it's a great device and satisfied purchase but overpriced for sure.

This is my first iPhone purchase , coming from oneplus 7 I don't have any regrets about the switch. Yes the switch was painful (especially because I lost all my whatsapp chats) but is worth it. comparing to oneplus 7, this phone has all features from it but in better form. My OP7 was smooth, fast had good battery camera,battery and  haptics. iPhone is just way smoother,fast and have great camera,battery and haptics. There is a slight learning curve. took 2 days to get used to gestures and navigations but is smooth sailing. the only negative feedback would be no charger in the box. You will have to get from apple.com if you want fast 20W one.

Huge leap for the standard iPhone

Upgraded from an iPhone 7 32 gigs to iPhone 12 . After holding out for a long time the upgrade was worth it. All the feature set display, camera, speakers, signal reception, chipset is a huge upgrade. Recommended if you happen to have a device from 2016 or older. This device will be the new standard iPhone for the next 4 years. So worth it if you get it now.

Now it's almost more than 2 weeks of usage and I'm fully satisfied with the performance. Earlier I was using oneplus 6T and after malfunction of the screen, i decided to move to Iphone. Before buying i had done all the R&D. Many of reviews says that it has bad battery life and couldn't stand a day. But as per my usages my battery stays all day long. I used to make call (6 to 7 hours), video, music, surfing everything except game and battery last upto 24 hours with data mode on.In my opinion its worth buying.

It’s my first iPhone ever and I bought it with my earned money through part time jobs in college✌️I am a tech freak so you can trust my views -- A14 Bionic is the fastest, most efficient and reliable processor till date- The camera focuses so quickly that you can take DSLR quality photos.- The screen size 6.1 inches is the most comfortable screen size out there and the OLED retina XDR display is so crisp and everything feels real.- The stereo speakers are so clear even on high volume and gives awesome vibe while listening to music- iOS has no bugs at all- 20W charging is lit 🔥- The Face ID feels like having no lock for yourself, there’s no issue while using Face ID even in the dark because it uses infrared rays to scan the faceDrawbacks -- Battery could be better

So till now what concerns me is only the battery and everything by far is top notch and I was a little hesitating before purchasing it since this was my first interaction with the iOS environment but now I am used to it and works fine. Since I am not a fan of too much customization so for me this UI is totally fine. Plus gaming experience was also good till now I played nfs no limit and it works like a champ. I also really like it's ram working since my app in background keeps running without always reloading it when again opened.One last since I haven't used 120 Hz refresh rate so I can’t tell about it but since my old phone was also no having it so for me it's awesome👌.Camera is also awesome till now I haven't used it much due to covid but in low light it worked too good no doubt about it:).Hope this will help someone😁

In an era when mobile handset is a must in everyday life, there cannot be anything better than an APPLE IPHONE.  It is always far far ahead of rest of the android phones.  No other phone can match it in terms of its superior quality, features, elegant look and finishing in general and in particular its use as a video camera.

The iphone is getting over heated real fast and far too frequently. This has been happening since the last 15 days, just 25 days after i bot it on 16jan22. This is not only unqumacceoatable keeping in mind Amazon's standards but also dangerous from health hazard point of view. Please change this product immediately.

I believe it's priced a little bit on the higher side but still it's better than its competitors. Display is less bright than I hoped, with okayish resolution.

Pros:-1. Display (Best display you can get at this price i.e.  Super Amoled with 90Hz Refresh Rate2. 🔋 Battery (6000 mAh big battery)3. Camera ( 64 mp) and selfie (20 mp) and if you  know you know samsung image processing  software.4. Looks and back Design ( Awesome Pattern with  rainbow 🌈 reflection.)5. Compact Size (6.4inches) not too big and not  too small.......handy..Cons:-1. Processor (mediatek helio g80) which is a low  end processor and it might not affect your  overall performance if you are not a heavy  gamer or something like that.2. Infinity U display. Nowadays drop notch display  is kinda outdated look since overall look of the  phone is great but this small thing is like a black  spot on a white chart paper.##But Also keep that in Mind how can you get  everything in just 14999 -17999 ........in mid  range...these specs are perfect and at last you  can trust the brand name too.😏

I am sure there will be many reviewers who will do an in-depth analysis and list out the pros and cons of the device. So here i am pointing out the negatives that i felt . First thing first, the ring volume is mediocre. Ring is not at all loud and i wondee whether I have recieved a faulty device.Second thing i loathe is that, the back cover is a fingerprint magnet. Some kind of resin or composite material is used.To be honest, i didn't like the phone much. The design is outdated and sub par a 10k phone. Since bought this for an elderly person, the ring volume was a total bummer for me. Thats it, another useless review from me.

First Samsung phone

I'm a just a basic user of phones.  No movies, no games.  I mainly use phone, messages, photos, chats and other social apps and some utilities.  For the price, the features seem impressive and for my mild usage this phone sounds great.What I did not like is the amount of apps that were already installed on the phone!  Then I had to un-select a whole bunch of ""recommended"" apps during setup.  I was pre-subscribed to 'diagnostics' and 'recommendation' and 'marketing' notification by default!  Is that allowed?  Some features don't work unless I use specific apps.  Basically, they are app features and not phone features.  Sounds 'grey-area' to me.After spending half a day to go through all the settings and clean up the mess I think I'm ready to use this phone.  I still wonder what else I missed...

Every time we need to on the button to check whether we have received any calls or messages*It is said that 15w charger but in adapter it says 10w (5.0 V = 2.0 A)*Too much of unwanted apps are pre-installed*Very outdated processor.

Feels like butter, great for everyone except hard-core gamers. Great overall experience offered.
","
Amazing phone. I would rank it the best overall phone experience. The pros are obviously known to everyone, the 90hz display is great. The touch feel is literally like butter. Cameras are great. Amazon prime runs in HD so widewine l1 is there. Speakers are loud, not tinny but lack bass. Can't complain.Phone requires careful first time setup to avoid ads as suggested by ranjit sir. No ads encountered yet. Everything works well, side mounted power button /finger print reader is fast and accurate. Light sensor, proximity sensor are flawless. These 2 are typically bad in Chinese phones (mi note 5 pro user) causing display to turn on when in call, so thumbs up.The cons: the processor seemed weak on paper, but the experience is great. Not that I am defending samsung, but a compromise 90% can blindly make. I do not play games, so can't say much but better processor phones out there. This is for general public who wants smooth experience of samsung phone and no software bugs.Some complained of emmc5 storage, but apps installed damn fast and I did not find and sluggish read write speed issue. Fast and phone did not heat during setup process when installing 100s of apps and no slowness observed. I have 2 m30s in house, they also pointed out better build quality, better looks of my black version and fluidity of screen. Good for light gaming. Go ahead with the phone for good vibes throughout phones life. Now samsung is giving 3 years of software updates, so great.

Worst Purchase online

This is my first review of Any product purchsed online. I'm shopping online since ages now. But this Phone FORCED me to write a review.I've been Using Asus Zenfone phones till date for my usage, Had a wonderful experience....First time ever shifted to Samsung just because of so called Brand Name.WORST DECISION.Camera OK.Battery OK.Performance OK.Screen OK.Brightness OK.Within 1 week Lock switch stopped working.I'm locking and unlocking by screen tap option because samsung people have said it'll take time to repair.Body completely cheap plastic material.Heats up with normal usage.When in pocket automatically wakes up and starts typing numbers or dials emergency number.With No disregard to Samsung I'm saying very bad phone you've made.Very overpriced. Should be of 9k or less.Others opinions may differ from me. This is just my personal experience.I'm sorry to give you less stars Samsung but please improve your quality not quantity. There is no mandate to launch new phone every week.

 The perfect phone under ₹15,000 with amazing features...I purchased this phone last month and received it on October 6th. It's been 1 month since i have used this phone and it works perfectly fine😊1. Amazing camera quality (64mp backcam and 20mp front cam)2. Superb battery life.. (6000 mah)3. Massive storage (128GB internal and 6 GB RAM)4. Finger print sensor at the right side of tge phone makes it even more special.. (power off/on button and the finger print sensor is the same)5. You can double tap on the screen to on/off the phone6. Face recognition7. Always on display options are available8. Video lockscreen option is available9. Good processor10. Good display11. Doesn't lag or slow downAnd many more exciting features...It's the best phone under this price range..I bought it for ₹14,000 during the great indian festival.I wonder why some people posted negative reviews about this perfectly amazing phone..If you have plans to buy this phone.. Go ahead.. you won't regret it..SAMSUNG IS THE BEST

Quality Camera, last longing battery, good screen resolution
","
Pros: Screen resolution is good. Speed and performance is ok ok. Sometimes got little sluggy during parallel execution. Camera is very good quality. Battery life is good. SW is really smooth. Speaker is louder enough. Finally it's not a Chinese brand.Cons: No 4k or HDR video viewing. So some videos are blurry even though it is HD. During charging phone gets heated up. Tats may be it has bigger battery. 5G support is not Der since most phones are now with 5G. Price might have been little less to compete Chinese brands.

Display is good and bright. Battery  average. It's not that speed being 6gb ram, while making  call it lags. Camera not upto mark, I miss grand camera which was better  than 64 mp. Over priced, don't have basic features  of other M series phone. On the name of brand Samsung started cheating people.  They should  atleast  provide  cover.

Phone Lags a lot
","
After purchasing Samsung M12, was looking forward to getting M31, but the mobile was not available and the prices increased. After waiting for a month, saw that M32 is available so purchased it but not entirely happy with it. The phone rings on its own at times, chimes continuously other times without any call or notification being given. Phone lags at time and opening apps also takes time. Perhaps the 6gb variant is better but I have 4gb model. OneUI was supposed to be stable and I am quite disappointed with this particular purchase at least.

best Non-Chinese smartphone preference under 15K | Excellent battery | Decent Camera | Smooth | Stylish look | Mummy Loved it ( I gifted it to her)Not made for chhapri youth icons of India.Not the best camera phone under 15K.for gaming under 15k > Motorola G40 / POCO is better option.if you are a decent user, who loves to watch videos/ browse social apps then definitely go for this.for Mumma/PAPA this would be best choice rather than Chinese smartphones.(Thumbs UP) BATTERY : Screen On Time > More than 13H for Mumma. she watches Jio Tv & browse social apps quite often.(Processor) MTK G80 doesn't lag much as compare to Exynos processors + it is better optimized for battery consumption. example Samsung M21 2021 with same 6k mAh battery with Exynos processor gives 7-9h Screen on time only, while Samsung m32 with same 6K mAh battery with MTK Processor gives more than 10-12H screen on time.

Using since last three days ...completely satisfied with everything. In this segment so many phones are available but if i get the SAMSUNG then why i should go anywhere else...Pros:Display - SAMOLED with Full HD, Side Curves make you feel so happy. Brightness is awesome.Sound - Dolby Sound is also good specially with wired headphone.Battery - Without internet 2 days do not worry to charge it and with internet one full day.Call Quality : Also goodVideo Calling - BestCamera : Picture is so goodProcessor - Fast as it comes with 90Hz refresh rate.Cons:Notification LED Indicator is missing but can be managed.RAM could be 8 GB but if you choose the quality then it can be also ignored. 6GB also working fine.Verdict: If you are not a GAMER then blindly you can grab it.

Great display, great camera but comes with a couple of catches
","
From my usage over a month and taking it to a trip where network reception was absent 90% of the time, my reviews are this:-Display is great, surely compares to flagship devices, the sAMOLED Infinity-U display is really something else, bright, brilliant, vibrant and with the 90Hz refresh rate (laggy animations appear sometimes), quite responsive too. It is miles ahead from smartphones in this range.-Camera is pretty nice actually and surprised me a bit, especially from budget Samsung line, however, it does have a habit of oversaturation in some minuscule scenarios, low-light photography is average, just average as can be expected from phones of this range.-Battery is AVERAGE at best, please keep this in mind before buying, don't let the 6000mah figure fool you, for powering a display of that much calibre the battery lasts a day to a day and half depending on usage but NOT more than that in any case. The 15w charger provided requires a good 2-2.5 hours to charge up the 6000mah battery. 90hz display is a battery drainer, so I set mine on 60hz for the trip, for office/home scenario where frequent charging is not an issue 90hz is great albeit laggy animations appear sometimes.-Back panel is polymer based and is prone to fingerprints, smudges and scratches, so a light case is the right way to go.-Network reception is great for both WiFi and cellular and does not suffer from the low signal issues faced by some M31 users, etc. Bluetooth works well too.-Fingerprint sensor is snappy but coming from a phone where it was present on the back, it takes time getting used to and is sometimes just a tad bit slow, nothing to worry about.-External speaker volume is bad to average, it is not at all loud, I am not criticising this, maybe a lot a of people prefer quiet phone speakers but it is sometimes hard to hear ringtone or notification sounds especially from a phone where notification LED is absent.-Always on Display is present but reduces the battery percentage 1-2% at most.Summing up the above, overall, great viewing experience, camera is alright, battery is average, speakers are disappointing.-STRICTLY NOT a performance beast by any means, great for everyday or business usage. NOT for gaming.-Have not observed heating issue as of yet.Hope this helps, Cheers!

In-depth detailed Review ↓
","
Writing this review after almost a month of using the product.First off, I want to emphasize that the value for the product is just great.Build Quality:The body & screen are toughened and have a premium feel. The ""rainbow"" reflective back seems a bit weird to me, I would rather prefer a plain, smooth finish but that's just my personal opinion.Camera:Okay, this is probably the biggest topic to discuss on. Camera quality does not depend on the megapixels, it depends on the processing engine of the device. Megapixels are only useful for zooming in. So whether you have a 64MP phone, or a 108MP phone, the pixels don't matter. The processing engine matters (which is why the iPhone 11 with just 12MP shoots way better photos).The camera is mediocre, neither too good nor too bad. It does have a night-mode which is pretty decent. If you are into professional photography, you're better off with the Oneplus Hasselblad or the iPhone.But if you just take photos casually to post on social media, it does its job pretty well.Size & ease-of-usage:One can be a bit skeptical when using a device that is sized more than 6 inches. However, Samsung absolutely nailed the ease of use with the inbuilt scroll gesture on the power button. The power button is sort of like a laptop's touchpad, when you swipe down on the button, it will open the notification tray from where you can get access to your WiFi controls, etc. To close the menu you just have to swipe up on the power button. This is a really unique & useful idea because when you can use only one hand, it is uncomfortable to scroll through the top of the screen, but this gesture makes it super easy!Processor & Performance:Being a previous Snapdragon user, I was skeptical about moving onto the Mediatek family of processors. But given the size of RAM & storage, this device is perfect for semi-competitive gaming. Of course, you cannot expect it to perform like the Asus ROG Phone series, but you can get around 45-60fps at high graphic settings on AAA titles, which is pretty good. The 90Hz screen is fantastic too, and the gameplay experience is smooth & fluid.Screen:Not much to say here, it performs as expected. The 90Hz sAMOLED display is crisp & smooth. You also have an option to switch to 60Hz refresh rate to save battery.Battery:Just super! You can easily go for 3 days without a charge if you're not a frequent user. Medium gaming for 1 hour consumes around 6-8% battery. But if you just use it for messaging/calling/checking mails and casual gaming, the 6000mAH will easily last you for 2-3 days.Final verdict:I think that Samsung has done a really good job with the price range here. The phone offers plenty of features, which, as compared to the price are justified. If you're looking for a device around the 15k price range, go for it!

Great phone for the price, but certain things disappoint

First the good things:1. Audio is loud enough & Dolby Atmos works excellent with earphones / speakers.2. Display is crisp & is clear even outdoors.3. Front Camera is good, the photos come out clear even in dim indoor light.4. Mobile doesn't hang or crash unlike previous Samsung mobiles.5. Mobile isn't too heavy & feels just right in the hand.6. Camera is great outdoors & has a number of options including Pro mode & a very decent macro mode.7. Good battery backup. Lasts a day for normal use & videos. Display is amazingly clear & the phone speakers are loud enough to be heard all over the house.Now for the not so great part:1. What's with the sheer cheap plastic sim tray? The tray broke instantly while trying to install the sim. Had to spend Rs. 800 for a new one & this was on the day the mobile arrived.2. The touch lags. It's a very obvious lag & it takes a nudge or two for the mobile to respond.3. The Camera zoom is an utter waste. Don't even bother zooming at 10x.4. Comes preinstalled with a lot of useless apps & can't remove half of them.6. 3GB of 6GB RAM is always taken. For what?4. The finger printer scanner is at the most bizarre place. It's at the right hand side, bang in the middle where it doubles as the power button. It's real crazy to use & doesn't recognize fingerprints easily.5. Charger adapter provided is not 15W, but 10W. Takes about 2 hours to charge.6. No screen protector, no ear phones, no back cover. Samsung is really saving up on the small essentials.Should you buy this phone? Sure! Go ahead & buy if it's a regular everyday usage phone you're looking for. It looks premium, it looks stylish, & with all the features you want.

HANGSUNG - Horrible Phone
","
HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !The phone hanged multiple times during initial setup process, there are very visible jitters and lags while even navigating the UI.Please note this phone does NOT have UFS storage since it comes with EMMC 5.1 which is comparatively slow, also the G80 processor is poorly optimized for the device.The OneUI have some bloatwares and lots of useless apps from samsung, it also push these useless apps via OTA updates so make sure that you uninstall the apps only after you do the OTA update or else it will appear once again after the update.The only pro that I could say is that the display is decent and bright, the speakers also sound pretty decent at max volume.I would suggest you to go for Narzo 30 or Redmi Note 10s or the poco X3/M3 pro or even Realme 8 at this price range.

The only good thing this phone has is camera quality and display. Battery is ok. 6000 mah is big so can last one whole day. It's processing speed is nothing.

But its performance worth 40-50k. Its super fast, good storage,camera Quality is also good. Biometric scan is good. The screen quality is off the charts because its 90hz and 1080p display. You wont be able to use any other phone after using this. The battery life is good, i used it for 3 days without charging and its fast charging takes Almost 2 hours to full charge from 0-100%. I have been using it for almost a month and really enjoyed it. My old phone was Samsung Galaxy J7 NXT. It lasted 6+ years without any problems.

I've used only samsung smartphones for past 10 yrs and avoided Chinese sets. But while the Chinese phones have matured up with time, Samsung has gone downwind.While this phone is decent to look at, it's camera is a total turndown: pictures as well as the camera software - both are like 6000/- phone. Processor is so slow, it takes several seconds to display image thumbnails sometimes. Further, it has got innumerable bloatware that you cannot uninstall or disable. The UI crashes or hangs too often. Paid 12k for this slow, 64GB device while many others offer better processors and 128 gb storage at this price. Regret buying it, totally.

Review after 3 weeks of usage:The processor is clearly NOT up to the mark despite having a 6GB of RAM to play with. It is slow and it feels lagging and takes a second to open stuffs. Perhaps, an Exynos could have done wonders under 6GB RAM. Surely, not for gaming and for young generation in general who would want things to be speedy and quick! The camera quality is average for its class.""BUT"" - I bought it for my mother. And the SAMSUNG M32 is EXCELLENT for her usage.The brilliant S-AMOLED Display is a treat to look at. My mother watches YT videos, Insta Reels for fun and usually stays busy on WhatsApp Video calls and social media - FB and others. And this is where this phone excels with its crisp display and long battery life.So, I'm satisfied with this purchase. I would any day choose a finely tuned Samsung S-AMOLED over Chinese half-baked AMOLED/TFT/ FHD displays. Plus, it comes with 6 months free Screen Replacement warrenty  - you know, just in case.Decide yourself what you really need from this phone and whom are you buying this for?I hope my review helps with your decision.

Very erratic software issue even after repeated updates
","
I had a samsung M31 which rarely gave me any issues, so I automatically opted for M32 when it was time for a new phone. The new M32 software is making me want to never invest in a Samsung phone again.There is a huge issue with the accidental touch protection feature which Samsung is failing to acknowledge.  If you have done the mistake of choosing to switch on this feature, the notification for the accidental touch protection turns on and it keeps flashing it continuously and does not let you cancel it, or log in or even turn off the phone. It makes the phone unusable for a lot of time till you push a lot of buttons, do plenty of trial and error and somehow get the phone to restart or switch off somehow.  This is a show stopper and is absolutely unacceptable for a brand new phone.This is of course in addition to pushing a whole bunch of Samsung software which are absolutely unneeded.  This version is also way bulkier than M31. The camera etc is good but no other feature is usable if your phone itself becomes unusable so it doesn't matter.

I bought this phone as secondary phone so features hardly matter to me, however if someone is planning to buy this as primary phone then my suggestion that you opt for 6gb Ram coz the only drawback I have witnessed is that phone is little slow in response , mind it I'm saying slow that doesn't mean it hangs as I'm using 4gb ram so I advise 6gb ram for primary user. The best part of the phone is Display and Battery and trust me when it comes to display even 30k Chinese phones can't compete to samsung display. I'm long time Samsung user since 2015 and currently using s20 plus have tried I phone , one plus 8 pro but no one can beat samsung in their gorgeous SAmoled screen

The phone is good, got it for 13.5k during the December sale with a bank offer.Took a long to dispatch, but finally got it.Upon opening, I was disappointed to see dust particles around the front and back of the phone, and also the inner battery compartment was torn, maybe during shipping someone would have thrown on that side hardly IDK.Installed the screen protector right when I got it, while preparing the screen identified two scratches. Not sure whether I got a used one or not, but since I needed a phone badly accepted it.Would have given 5 stars cutting 2 because of the experience. Maybe they need to pack such fragile things properly and don’t send returned ones (not sure about this but how come dust can come inside?).

Phone performance is much better then any one at this price range.Samsung pho e comes with one ui makes user experience better then miui or colour os of xiomi and realme.its 90 hz refresh rate make u feel faster and smoother specially when during scrolling phone. Camera quality is decent but good at this price.overall happy with overall performance. This phone gives u complete package in terms of performance experiences and looks.i have brought this phone for my mom..and durability and smother experience was my preference and im glad Samsung provides both.

Good as per pricing
","
pros: Display, Battery, Camera (in light)Features, Overall lookCon: Camera performance in low light is not so satisfactory, UI is not fluid not smooth, it feels using like cheap quality brand, Ringing volume is low which is a problem, no case and screen protector inside the box, power adapter is not powerful for quick charging.

DO NOT BUY. Can't even exchange
","
Update after 2 months: As if connectivity issues and extreme slowness + lag wasn't enough, this model does not even appear as an option to be exchanged for any other mobiles. Super pathetic.Do not buy this phone. It has severe connectivity issues. It looses network connectivity in every 2 to 3 mins. I am regretting my purchase and placed a request for replacement the same day. Unfortunately Amazon doesn't trust and would like an engineer to test the issues before replacing despite same day replacement request.

I bought it for 11,300 during the Great Indian Sale and i feel it's best considering the price i bought it...but still I'd like to give my honest feedback. Here's what i felt about this phone..Pros:1. FHD+ SAmoled 90 Hz Display2. 6000mah Battery3. Mediatek G80(Thank god no Exynos)4. Good responsive Fingerprint scannerCons:1. Build quality is average( it has plastic back but considering the price it's ok but still it could have been a bit better)2. Slow charging ( Samsung says it supports upto 25W charging but provides a 10W charger.. Imagine how long does it take for a 10W charger to charge a massive 6000mah battery?)3. Plastic back is fingerprint magnet( it easily gets fingerprint marks)4. No back case provided in the box.I've not tested any high end games like BGMI as I'm not a gamerFinal verdict: It's an all-rounder. Go for it.Thanks to Amazon..literally delivered the product less than a day

Display no doubt best but do not expect great visual as compared to flagship...phone is only for casual use please use It as a calling and music ND for video purpose...because it lags even in day to day tasks...90hz is only a hype it just okk...battery backup is good so far...camera avargae...fast charging not recommended bcz battery will die faster if you want this phone for 2 or 3 years then use only 15watt charger...

 Well the styling of the handset is good, the handset feels premium in this budget, a better processor and 6 Gb Ram does good job for daily usual tasks and for playinv games.The phone has a 3.5 mm jack but is not supplied by handsfree set, earphones.The 15W turbo charging is good but in case of you forget the charger and try to charge using USB mode etc.. it takes ages to get charging done.The back side styling of the handset is quiet nice camera set up is also good.

Samsung is best in market for display, battery and its UI, this model once again proved it.Pros:Battery: The biggest advantageDisplay: Best in classUI: Very smoothSidemounted finger print is super fast and easy to use.Back panel design looks cool.Cons:Design is hulky compared to previous versions.Samsung at this price could provide glass panel.Rear Camera is biggest draw back.There is lag in UIOn power saving mode it doesnt allow 90ghzWifi calling is not doing the job for both the SIMs, works good for only one.There is lag on calls while using TWS over wificallingBattery drians faster when power saving mode is turned off.Touch protection needs to be improved while in pocket.Speakers are again drawback.Speaker volume on calls is very low.. doesnt work when in crowd.Still there is room for performance at this price 17k

Good phone from Samsung....I love Samsung brand products. Smooth interface ...nice big display. Powerful battery that lasts me for 3 days as I am not a gamer. Moderate weight of phone . Finger print scanner works just awesome. But the back panel/ cover of the phone getting scratches so easily.....It is looking dirty on back...! And the courier service of ecom express was pathetic. I had to enquire them about the parcel and reach their location to collect it. Very bad service. 1 star for courier service and 4 stars for my Samsung phone

The phone seems good to me. I am quite happy with it. I could have given 5 star rating. But one star less because I got a phone which display lower edge has a scratch which is not minor not major. I put a protector glass on it. Because of hand finger print it is not visible. Why samsung? Why this type of mistakes by a rrputed brand like you? Previously I got samsung galaxy tab a7 it has screen bleeding issue. I exchanged it. I got another tablet which doesn't have that issue but it side corners has marks(aluminium back) which are made when you drop it on hard surface or because of shock. Don't know what is doing samsung QA team

Samsung m32 4g started over heating in just 10 days. According to Amazon return policy its return period was 7 days so I can not return it at Amazon so contacted samsung customer care they said to return it fat samsung service center in 14 days. So I visited there but they didn't gave me exchange.Instead of that they tested my mobile for 4hours and said they updated my mobile software which I have already updated when I received it.After that same problem is continuing with me. It's 6000 mah battery don't last even 15 hours of normal usage and cherry on the top its battery takes 3:30 hours to charge from 5-100%. It has only one camera useful and that is 64mp remaing three are worse than worst.

 These so called Samsung Online model phones boast of superb features but failed to meet even the smallest standard of working without any complaints. I've been using this phone for the last 3 moths and I took it to service center for repair twice. Both times for display touch complaint and Board issue. They still haven't given any resolution. I demanded replacemet options, they said no. This made me lose the remaining trust I had on Samsung as a consumer brand.

This device is more than enough for kids who are attending classes from home, it can run light games but not any high end games which is surely not needed when this device is brought for online study purpose without worrying about kids will play games when there is no class, so there is winn-winn situation for parents without compromising with price and purpose.This is a great device.

Review of normal daily use.Pros:- Good display- Good battery backup - atleast 2 days- Good speed - no lag- Good call clarity- Fast fingerprint scan, can add upto 3 fingers- Call recording without announcement- Adaptive eye comfort shieldCons:- Presence of bloatwares (unwanted preinstalled apps)- Speaker is not loud- No backcase providedOverall it is a good phone to have. Weight of pros are above cons. If you are not a heavy gamer, just ignore low processor & emmc comments from others. They are just tech things which doesn't matter in daytoday use. Lag and ram usage reported from others is also probably due to unwanted apps. Unistall/disable them will solve the problem. Uninstall only after initial setup is done and after installing available phone update. Otherwise they will be forcefully installed again. After setup also it will try to install through Galaxy store. But it is under control if first setup done correctly ('geekyranjit M32' in youtube).Reduced 1 star only as a warning for Samsung to exclude bloatwares in upcoming models. Also they should not force to use Galaxy appstore.New Mi and Oppo models also have more bloatwares and additionally they have call recording announcement (other party will know that call is being recorded). In comparison, my recommendation is to consider M32. If you need a phone only for normal usage, then 4GB 64GB variant is enough.
"
4598,B096VD6RQG,"
A great budget phone
","
The M32 is a great budget device that is capable of handling everyday activities. The best things about this phone are the presence of the 3.5 mm headphone jack and expandable storage. The cameras, fingerprint reader and S-Amoled display with the 90Hz refresh are excellent. However, battery life is rather poor, and the 6000 mAh battery seems like 4000 mAh, and drains quickly. Also, even though the phone runs on One UI 3.1, Samsung has throttled a lot of the features on this device, which is very disappointing. The MediaTek processor is subpar and the phone occasionally stutters. Do not expect flagship level performances from this device - however, it will get the job done if you're on the lookout for a budget phone.

Although it is not a 5g phone, but i am pretty much satisfied with overall price to performance ratio.I am not a gamer so i cant comment on the gaming performance of this phone.My father use it only for watching youtube videos, whatsapp and for phone calls (obvious).It has a 90 hz display and it is a very good display and i cant feel any difference from  a 120hz display phone.In a normal day to day usage l, it performs excellent with no lag or hang or whatso ever.However i cant comment on performance based cpu demanding task on this phone because i do my perforformance based based work flow on pc.This phone has inbuilt call recording feature which no other company is giving now a days.Till now there is no over heating issue in this phone.I also bought m52 5g in 26000, and i regret my decision considering poor price to performance ratio.I feel i would have bought the m32 4g for my self and could have saved 14000 rupees easily.Both phone run pretty smoothly and similarly except display size and camera placementOverall m32 is a good value for money.Considering 5g is not present, in real world, in fact is not a big deal, because when 5g will be available after 1 or 2 years, your current 5g phone will also become older at that time.So better to save money and invest later when 5g will be available on ground, because as at that time you will get much better price to performance ratio.

Redmi has been a prominent smartphone brand which has given a quality product at a pocket-friendly price range. I have a lot of expectation from Xiaomi. I have used almost 4 of their smartphone in last 2 Years but truely disappointed with Note 8.I Won't use the complex word & would like to make the review very simple & to the point.The Negative things of Redmi Note 8 are:-(1) 😔 Battery drains very fast if you're using Wifi, low signal area & of course while gaming like PUBG & COD. Needs to recharge after 6-8 hours. But 18W Fast charging will help you to charge quickly but that doesn't solve the entire problem. (2) 😡 Can't disable pre-installed apps. Lots of annoying ads & Can't give these phone to someone new to android or smartphone (eg. Parents because of unnecessary ads & you need to be very careful to handle them). (4) 💥 Flashlight very poor ( Note 5 Pro, A3 & Note 8 Pro has better flash). (5) 👀 Unnecessarily forces to use location in all apps (which is most annoying). Why is Mi so much interested in our location? (6) 📷 The Quad camera works fine but zoom doesn't make much difference. Good for normal use & Justify the price segment. (7) 🤮 Everyone tries to make UI & Design as simple to operate but Xiaomi MiUi is so disgusting & difficult to operate. (8) 🤕 Apps crash here and there. I hope they will consider this in upcoming updates.(9) 🔥 Heating issue while charging the phone & while using it for even 30 minutes.⚫ Overall: It is a nice phone for average use but if you're amazed by its so-called features & you think that it can survive your high-end requirement then be aware it is not for you.

The UNDISPUTED CHAMP OF THE BUDGET SEGMENT
","
I got this device on 1st November 1 week before our famous Jagadhatri Puja in Chandannagar and this was my best purchase till date.Design:- First of all this thing just glows. The very first moment I saw this phone I was literally drooling. The back and froth Gorilla Glass back gives this an unmatched premium feeling in the hand.So classy so elegant yet so eye catching and charming. At least 5-6 strangers have asked me about this device. This phone is sure a looker.Camera :- The camera can give competition to phones that are 2-3x more expensive than this.This phone with GCam 7 just blows the competition out of water, nothing even comes close.The GCam 7 works on this device so flawless without any lags or stutters whatsoever it's pure magic just see the samples, straight out of the camera.The selfies of this device are even better than iPhone 7 , I compared them side by side and the selfies frrom this one have better dynamic range, better contrast and better depth effect. Night Sight too works like a charmGCam7+ Redmi Note 8=♥️🔥The addition of wideangle and macro are just cherry on the top. Wide Angle takes decent shots is good lighting conditions and you can take videos with the macro cam as well. Both does the job pretty well. I will give the GCam 7 link at the end🤗Display:- The FullHD+ screen, yes a FullHD+ screen in a sub 10K phone, the screen is bright, vibrant produces great colour and contarsts and watching YouTube videos and movies makes the experience so much better.Performance:- 665 is a very well rounded SoC it's running very well, without any lags or hiccups experienced till date and PUBG runs pretty smooth without any lags and stutters whatsoever and this doesn't heats up at all.Battery and Charging :- I have experienced about 1 and 1/2 days of battery backup with moderate usage and thanks to the 18W fast Charge it charges up 0-80 in around 75mins.Speaker:- The downfiring speaker is very loud and crisp you can literally feel air pumping out of the speaker in a bass heavy song and the speaker has a self cleaning feature too. The earpiece is loud crisp  and clear too.This phone media consuming to much better.Extra Features:-IR blaster ✔️Gorilla Glass 5 back and front great hand feel, premium built and scratch resistant✔️Self cleaning speaker✔️Wireless FM✔️P2i coating✔️USB C✔️Fast 18W charger in the box✔️Cons:- There are ads in the UI but a mere 5mins of tweaking and voila you will never see a ad in your deviceVery very difficult to get hold off one in these flash sales.Overall this phone is redefining what a budget phone can do, from a Great built quality with Gorilla Glass 5 on both front and back, with downright best camera in this segment, to the presence of great speakers, to the presence of P2i water resistant coating which gives a great peace of mind to the presence of IR blaster, Wireless FM to the presence of USB C this phone is a perfect from every department no phone even comes close.If your budget is within Rs 12000 this is the best buy you can buy just go for it✌️Fair warning:- After using the GCam 7 on this device you will have a difficult time switching to any other phone even 2-3x more expensive cause the picture quality produced by this phone is just lit.Get this phone asap and Install GCam 7 and let this perfect combo amaze you♥️🔥Thanks for reading this review if you find this helpful like this and have a great day.

If you are planning to buy Redmi Note 8, check my experience as followsPro's :1. Camera: 48 MP Quad camera gives well exposed output. Note 8's camera is one of the Best in under 10k price segment.- It also have ultra-wide, macro depth sensor.- Front camera is also great.- Capable to shoot 4k 30 fps, slow motion 120 fps.2. Snapdragon 665: which is handles daily to day multitasking pretty well.3. 4000 mAH Battery: easily lasts for a day,18 watt charger included inside box which helps to charge mobile fully in 2 hours.4. Notification LED.5. IR Blaster.6. Dedicated SD card slot.7. Headphone jack.8. Gorrila glass 5 on front and back.Con's:- When playing PUBG with high settings, sometime it lags with frame drops.Verdict:If you are looking for phone for daily use with amazing camera quality, then Note 8 is right choice for you.But if looking for gaming then don't buy this one.

The phone has major touch glitches. After trying at least 3-4 times, got this phone recently. All the excitement of receiving a new phone vanished when the touch started acting up. The phone shudders and starts operating on its own without even touching it. The camera features are quite good but the phone should be made stable first. Disappointed. Don't buy in flash sale.

Good phone with few irritating discrepancies
","
side & Bottom border area keyboard keys are not working properly, like p, q, capslock, backspace, '?123', navigation keys like back, home etc. Sometimes they work sometimes they don't, it's very irritating when you have to correct spelling by deleting the misspelt word due to miss of the letter. At least 3 out of 10 hits are missing regularly. In addition to it, voice during the call is leaking in the earpiece, it's like I am hearing my own voice while talking. Poor feeling. Otherwise, the phone is working fine. Didn't expect this from such a brand. Really disappointed------------------------------------------REPLACED------------------------------------Got it replaced with another handset, though the keys I mentioned above seem to be responding fine now, other areas are giving similar problem, like the 'abc' key which is used to switch the keyboard from letters to number and symbols. Also, after dropping down the notification shade the setting gear icon is not responding properly.  Screen touch issues lies in many places over the screen. So the hit-miss pattern is still on but on some other areas. This is very irritating. The voice leak during call still lingering over some or other calls.

Not a smooth ride
","
After all the hype I managed to buy the blue colour variant 4GB/64 GB. My initial impressions were very disappointing and after using the phone for two weekks I can safely say that phone has some bugs and quallity issues which I would like to mention:1) Biggest flaw is notification icons disappearing from the notification shade after appearing for few seconds. I tried my best to fix it by going through number of suggestions available on internet including factory reset. Hopefully Xiaomi will try to fix it.2) The flashlight/torch is very weak and even my older Redmi Note 3 has brighter torch/flashlight.3)Camera is pretty average and hard to believe how the 48 mp mode is giving average pictures. Wide angle mode is also poor and the other two modes are in my opinion just gimmick.4)One basic flaw if you are using two sims the second sim icon will be displayed only when you are using wifi.  I am really disappointed with these bugs/defects and just hope this is my last association with Xiaomi. Last but not thr least if you are looking for a ohone with great experience of gaming then you should not opt for this phone.To conclude if you are a Xiaomi fan just opt for 10k version and hope that some of the errors mentioned above are fixed by Xiaomi.Review after MIUI 11 Update:- I got an OTA for MIUI 11 on 27th November 2019. After the update the problem of disappearing notification icons from the notification shade has been solved. Second sim icon is also now displayed in the notification shade which was earlier missing. I can now say without any hesitation that this is the best phone in 10k range.

Nice device with 4G+
","
Very good device. Everyone knows the specs already so I would only mention what's not mentioned in specs.First, a CON, though it has a good processor yet you will get a see little hiccups here and there. I have 6gb version and I believe 4gb version will have more of these hiccups in performance. Don't get me wrong here, performance is above average but minor hiccups are still there, not a phone for hardcore gamers at least, for day to day operation it is quite good.Second, a PRO, device supports 4G+ and speeds are quite good. I have both Jio and Airtel. Jio gets me 15-20mbps on LTE-A and Airtel gets me more than 50mbps. So the network speeds are excellent for the price paid. This CA thing is not mentioned anywhere in specs. I can't tell you what bands CA works on coz it's not rooted yet to check the exact bands, but it works, and this is a first for a Xiaomi device in this price range. And guys getting Carrier Aggregation in 10k device is really a nice thing.And lastly, I was using a OnePlus 6 before this so I might be comparing them performance wise, an average user would find the device excellent in terms of value for money. Xiaomi seems to be upping the game given the competition from the likes of Realme.Rest you know it all, that's about it from me.

The most disappointing think is that the SIM slot is put already by the company upside down and slightly bend from the top I have to bend it also on the other side to make it straight and when I put the SIM there is no chance that will keep the SIM card but it show the SIM card range so it means it's not damage just slightly bend and I don't like the redmi branding on the front I am expecting the clean look

A good processor ( though better one snapdragon 710 is available at same price with realme 3 pro)4. 48 mp ( really a 16mp) camera is superb5. Four camera setup gives flexibility to your photograph with wide angle and macro lens6. Night photos are also good7. 18 watt fast charg support and also inside the box availableCons.1. Glass design may get cracked when fall down from height.2. SD 710 is also available at same price range from realme3. Redmi may have used Samsung gm2 48mp sensor which is better compared to gm1.4. Though wide angle camera is good it is still an 8mp5. The Qualcomm quick charge is very slow when compared with VOOC6. It has been long days (4-5 years) redmi is using 4000mAh battery. Though it is big enough but battery capacity should be increased to 4500mAh same as its pro versionIf I find anything else I will update it.

A Complete All-rounder
","
Redmi note 8 is a complete all-rounder.This review is after 15 days of usage.The pros of this phone are as follows1) PriceI got it at an effective price of Rs.8500 during the sale days. Even then @Rs.10000 it is still a very good buy.2) Built QualityThe phone is extremely sturdy, which might be very helpful for rough and tough use. And the glass back gives a very premium feel but need to be extra careful for that.Also Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection is very helpful.3) BatteryThe battery easily lasts for more than a day with mediocre usage.4) Quick chargingThe co. a fast charger in the box, it takes around 1 hour 45 min to charge from 0 to 100.5) ProcessorIt works extremely well for day to day tasks (don't know about high CPU consumption games like Pubg and all)6) Sound qualityThe Audio speaker is loud for a normal environment.7) Dedicated SD card slot8) SizeThe phone is 6.3 inch, though bigger than palm sized phone, it is always an better option than the 6.5 inch phones which have become a trend in today's market.Cons1) CameraThe quality of camera is not like 48mp. Its not that great nor that bad. It's okay okay types.2) BloatwareThere are huge no. of pre installed apps and the ads are still very much a part of OS.3) Flash SaleI think the concept of flash sales should be dropped , due to this many people could not avail the discounts during the festive sales.4) Heating IssueThe phones heats up a bit while charging but it's completely normal considering the fast charging and other factors.5) BulkyThe phones seems bulky at times. Its somewhere round 200 gmsConclusion:The best buy at @10000 at this price range and the features.Could not ask for more.

Faulty product.

I was very happy that I bought it in first sale but my happiness ruined because Amazon delivered me a faulty product. Whenever I try to turn on my mobile from sleep it always take 5 to 8 seconds to just turn on the screen, no matter whether I am trying with fingerprint sensor/Double tap method or pressing right side button. I tried to replace the product but Amazon checked my phone with some terrible blancco app and said that there is no fault in my mobile. They didn't replaced it. pathetic. Don't purchase this mobile from here.

Great VFM camera mobile under 10k
","
Best VFM among current phones if not looking for a gaming centric phone.Ratings:Build quality: 10/10Display: 6/10 (no colour accuracy and viewing angle from bottom gives dull display, not very legible outdoors as only 390 nits brightness. Only saving grace is the FHD resolution)Cameras: 8/10 (9/10 with gcam) , wide angle 8MP too less, very less details when zoomed in.Battery backup & Charging speed: 9/10 (unfortunately no new charging animation as shown in promotion material)UX/OS: 6/10 (not buttery smooth), 8/10 (after uninstalling bloatware, disabling ads and installing Nova launcher)Speaker: 8/10 (loud & clear enough but sounds a bit tinny/hollow-ish compared to my Moto g5 plus)Call quality & network reception: 8/10Overall considering price: 9/10Good packaging and quick two day delivery by Amazon (non Prime)Edit (5-Dec-2019): After MIUI 11.0 update the new battery charging animation is now available. Hooray! :D

Redmi note 8 | worth every penny
","
I am fully satisfied with this phone, battery is good, screen quality is good especially the black, it looks like amoled display.Gg5 glass on top is so solid that even geans can't scratch the glass, it is far superior than redmi note 7. It worth the upgrade. I got a 170k score on antutu which is very high on this price segment.The cameras are the main highlight of this phone, the 48mp takes amazing pictures and videos(4k) at night, pixel binning comes very handy at night situations.The macro camera is also good, don't bother the 2mp resolution, it takes amazing pictures.The ultra wide lens is very nice, it takes pictures at 120° angle.There is a glass covering on the fingerprint which makes it very easy to clean it.The depth sensor with the help of mi camera takes very eye catching portraits.The most amazong part is the phones comes with a 18watt charger in the box, it charges my phone from 20 to 95 percent in 1 hour.I prefer the moonlight white color of this phone, it looks so premium.

I have had various Redmi Note phones right from Redmi Note 3. The Note series is amongst the best value for money phones. I considered for long about going for the Pro version but decided to settle for the normal version with 6GB / 128GB as it seemed to meet all my requirements for 3k less. Here are the pros and cons from my initial use.PROs1. Big long 6.3 inch screen that is comfortable to hold in hand.2. Decent sunlight legibility of screen in bright outdoors even though it is not AMOLED.3. Good camera, especially for the macros. It also works with GCam, the wonderful Google Camera app.4. Butter smooth performance with MIUI 10 on Android Pie.5. Dedicated SD card slot (not hybrid) apart from two 4G nano sim slots.6. Good battery life that would last about 1.5 days for moderate use with GPS off.7. Good reception and clear voice for calls.8. Low SAR radiation levels reduces health risks.9. Comes with a TPU back case. No need to buy a case. The Space Black version comes with a tinted black semi transparent flexible case. It looks good on the phone. Nice touch Xiaomi!10. Gorgeous Corning 5 glass on back and front.11. Sound output is good. Has a 3.5mm jack as well.12. Comes with goodies like FM radio as well as an Infrared emitter that allows it to be used as a TV remote.13. It comes with a 18W fast charger in the box and uses the superior USB C port.14. Ultra fast fingerprint recognition as well as face unlock.CONs1. The corner curves are a little too curved. A smaller curved area might have looked better. But then that is my personal taste. :)2. The front camera notch is a little bigger than is obvious from the pictures.3. The back camera juts out of the surface and would be prone to scratches. Using a case, like the one that comes in the pack would alleviate the issue.4. The camera app can be improved a bit.For the price there is hardly any phone that compares in features. Go for it! Or if you can spare a few thousands go for the Note 8 Pro.Hope you found the review useful on making a decision.

Redmi note 8(4gb,64gb,Moonlight White) Pros & Cons:
","
Redmi note 8(4gb,64gb,Moonlight White)Pros & Cons:"" Redmi launches it's new phone in the indian market from the price 9999.I'm using this phone for last 4days and this is my review.Redmi Note 8 's most attractive thing is its look,this phone comes with a glossy glass back with white and blue shade and side edges are made of plastic but it just looks like stainless steel and it run MiUi 10 based on android 9,gives you preety cool experience,but this custom ui have so many bloatware and ads.Second thing is its camera,note 8 comes with a 48mp quad camera array.first one is a 48mp camera with pro mode and ai mode.second one is 8mp 120° wide angle lens with f/2.2 really works good.third one is 2mp portrait lens for bokeh effect in photo.last but not the least is a 2mp macro lens to shoot ultimate macro shoots through your phone.And it's 13mp camera with AI mode really clicks good selfies.Next is processor,this phone comes with SD 665 processor with cloak speed of 2.01 ghz for a faster and smoother experience with adreno 610 gpu.But this phone doesn't support Pubg in Hd mode.That's a bad thing for gamers.Next is display,note 8 comes with a 2280×1080p resolution IPS display with 403ppi pixel density.And it's colour production is really good.But this phone doesn't comes with Widevine L1 certification, that's why you can't stream Netflix or Amazon Prime in full hd.But it have Widevine L3 certification.Next is battery,this phone comes with a powerful battery of 4000 mah and you will get almost one and a half day usage experience through your one time full charge.For a user like me who doesn't leave his phone for a second, it's a great thing.Interestingly this phone comes with a 18w fast charger in box.So,you can also charge your phone in no time.Next one is it's incredible sound.I just love it and i'm sure you will also love it too.It's immersive sound covers a medium sized room with high bass and treble.And there is a feature in phone called 'clear your speakers' that's also a good thing.I am telling you guys you will just love this phone.It's a killer phone from Xiomi in this price segment.If you are thinking of buying this phone,just go for it.Hope this review will helpful to you.

Awesome delivery.... Got in Just One Day...Thanks Amazon !!Product looking Awesome...Review after two days full use..Looks - Premium looks with extra durability of Gorrilla Glass Protection on both side.Display - Fantastic. Clean and sharp texts, real colors. Video colors look realistic.Touch & Feel - Very smooth like butter, very responsive fingerprint and face unlock. Unlocking in no time.Back Camera - Very Good, Sharp and real color images in every lighting conditions. Works more better with gcam.Front Camera - Awsome selfies can be produced with no efforts.Processor - Great, Multitasking is fun, you can use many apps at one time without any lags. Gaming is fast enough for almost every big game.Battery Backup - Perfect for full day normal usage with all type of applications. Fast charging takes almost 2hrs from 1-100%.At last I want to say that this device is one of the best device int this price. I used .. I was concerned about some forced apps provided by Xiaomi but after using phone, I found that they are not a big deal. You can uninstall unusfull apps or just disable notifications of them.Adding some random images for camera quality.I think this review will be HELPFUL for making a good decision.

update:- after GST hike review...In my last review, I was pretty happy with this phone and I am still like this phone in these 6-7 months I've learned something about redmi note 8 that I wanna share1. I can't find the type of ram they used but storage is eMMC rather than faster UFS storage.2. The phone feels bulky either on hand or in the pocket it weighs about 200 grams.3. no issue while gaming even in the heavy games it handles games quite smoothly4. face unlock is surprisingly quick works with various angles and as usual fingerprint is lightning fast...5. sometimes UI files laggy while switching between tabs not because it's underpowered because of lack of UI optimization.6. default camera app suffer from finding focus when it's close to an object but it can easily be fixed by the third-party camera app like Gcam8. in 11000 people are still buying this phone and they ain't wrong, but now it's not as compelling as it was before when it priced at 10000 rupeesold reviewphone build quality is great but same as note 7/pro in fact this is the same phone as redmi note 7/pro + 2 extra camerasdisplay:- this is a decent display and color accuracy is good I but don't think that it renders HDR content on its screen otherwise HDR support is basically a novelty here so I'm not complaining.battery is great I am getting about 6-7 hrs screen with heavy use you can get even more if you are a moderate user.camera is good but not great if you compare with Vivo and Oppo like oppo A5 2020. with default camera app photos come out Sharpe, vivid and bit warmer than natural condition. in bright daylight wide-angle lens take usable photos but photos are less sharp and lack dynamic range and that two depth and macro camera it's hard to imagine my self using in day to day life, with gcam photos come out sharp are natural and night its night mood is far far batter than stock miui night mode.Pro tip:- if you don't care about theming your redmi phones and want bloat and add free experience change region to UK after that you are not able to customize your phone by the themes app but you have no longer to deal with those spammy and annoying ads.

In note 8..But overall if we see the budget ..under 10 000/- mobile is best. Any one can purchase without any hesitation..it will fullfill all requirements..But not good for lower network areas like villagesAlso one thing battery drainage is very fast..

My Usage:1. Watch a lot of Youtube, Netflix, Prime..2. Constantly switch apps (Whatsapp,Telegram)3. Using Bluetooth all time with occasional GPS (to connect my Amazfit Smartwatch)The phone:1. Ram Management excellent! Continues apps where you left off.2. SAMOLED Display worth it. At this price point I would say it gives a good competition to Moto G71.3. I'm not a camera centric person and rarely take photos, but the camera quality and processing is so good on this device. You can take vibrant photos, even night mode is pretty amazing and clean. Supports timelapse and other stuff. Look out for updates.4. Battery life - 1 to 1.5 days max, also 30 W dart charging is supported (35 mins to 80-85% charge, then 20-25 mins to 100%) which makes up for it. For me by the end of the day I have 31-35% battery left)5. Still Supports and gets updates regularly although this was launched almost a year ago. Look out for the C.05 Update (check the cons below)6. Almost forgot to mention, the Build Quality is good, plastic back which looks like glass. Its light weight compared to other phones in this price segment.The Cons:1. The MAIN problem I faced was the lack of 4.5G or also known as Carrier Aggregation. This is something that can be unlocked with a software update but realme haven't done so. And nobody knows why. The hardware chip support 4.5G yet realme won't allow it. But VoLTE is supported. If you are a internet speed conscious user then it will affect your video load time(buffering). 2. AVOID C.05 UPDATE : This is a small thing I noticed but the default stock OS(Realme UI 2.0) without updates is the best in terms of perfomance, but if you don't update you will lose out on the big good features in Realme UI 3.0.I updated to Realme UI 3.0 Version C.04 which was good, then to C.05 which had problems during phone unlock, then now recently updated to Version C.06 which fixed all issues from previous update and working good so far, I can see some battery drain tho maybe 1-2% more.Overall I would say PLEASE avoid updating to version C.05, it has finger print unlock issues, 1/10 unlock attempts you will see a black screen after unlocking the device which will affect your daily work.FINAL VERDICT:If you want good battery life, performance, Amazing SAMOLED Display, in-display fingerprint scanner, Good Camera then go for this phone for a tight budget.But do consider the other phones as well in this price segment as 5G will be released this year + this phone does not support 4.5G yet as of being in 2022.Alternatives:Moto G71 - Similar specs, but stock android xp.Realme 9 Pro +  -- The price is a little high, but it has the best specs and also supports 5G. (Check the variant)As for Indian Brands:Lava Agni 5G -- Similar specs, but side fingerprint scanner and IPS LCD Display.Edit: I have installed C0.7 (Android 12) Update and so far seems very stable in everyday usage. Ofc battery life in little less compared to Android 11 A24/26 update.

Its so thin while having massive 5000mAh battery and offers great value and privacy safe device for those who don't trust chinese brands for privacy. There are much more privacy settings than samsung, xiaomi, vivo, etc.

Disappointed with Realme and Amazon on camera and overall performance of mobile
","
Camera quality is very poor both selfie as well as real camera , unthinkable photo quality. 64mp camera quality photo look like 5mp camera quality photo or less than that. Mobile also hang something. If I use it for a little bit of time then it starts to heat up i.e., we can say Heating Problem is also present.Very much disappointed with Realme and Amazon . Such a low quality mobile selling with too much high price 😔 . Overall performance is also not upto the good. Please help me to solve the problem

Good phone in good price
","
I have been using this phone for 2 weeks and it's really best phone in this price range . Performance is quite good and that cyber black design is lit and overall OS of realme is good and features rich and u can even game on it not that intense but yeah good enough according to price . I am not satisfied with its camera quality in Indoor low light conditions but in outdoor conditions it's good and yeah that fingerprint reader in display is not that fast and accurate but according to price range no other brand offers in display fingerprint scanner .

Received the phone two hours ago. Here are my first impressions:Most of the reviews here are made by just looking at price point and the specs sheet. I am giving a genuine first impression.Pros:1)Amazon's delivery: It just two days delivery and packing was good. No problem here2) Display: Samsung being Samsung here. Display is top class. Buttery smooth with 120 Hz refresh rate. One of the best displays you will find in any phone at this price point3) Cameras: I do not have much knowledge of cameras and I don't click much photos. But still they are descent enough. OIS is also present which is cool. Will update more on camera performance when I click few more pictures. Front camera is good as well.4) Performance: Well just two hours of usage so cannot really comment on it. But whatever I have used till now, I didn't face any issues. 778G happens to be a good processor so it won't cause any problems in future as well.5) Connectivity: Tried on both WiFi and 4G. Connectivity is very good. WiFi worked full speed even when I was 10 metres away from router6) Software: One UI is very good to have on any phone. Will definitely get two major android updates so it will not make phone to feel outdated after two years unlike most Chinese phones out there. No problems on software front.Cons:1) Look is not at all premium. It does not feel like you are holding a 37k phone in your hand. They have tried to make it look like a plastic body version of S21 series but still it does not feel premium when you hold in your hand. There are bezels on display as well which feel annoying. Only pro here is that the camera setup looks very good from back.2) Back side of phone is fingerprint magnet. You got to use a case, which unfortunately is not present in the box.3) They have provided only 15W charger though it supports up-to 25W charging.4) Storage option is 8+128 which is disappointing. It should have been 8+256. Also they didn't mention if it is ufs 3.1 or not anywhere.4) Off course the price of phone. It should have been few thousands less.So why did I bought this phone?I truly give more importance to software rather than hardware. I am not a heavy user, I play games very rarely. I wanted a phone with descent enough hardware but with great battery and more importantly OS upgrades. I was actually waiting for Pixel 5a to be launched in India but there are no signs of it so I went ahead with this one. I feel that Samsung will not disappoint me on software front. I will be able make full use of hardware provided with this phone.I you do not want to buy a Chinese phone and if you really care about phone's software, you should go ahead with this one. Trust me any normal user like me does not need sd870 or 888 for their daily work. What they need is great battery life phone with some pleasant UI. If you fall in this category , just go with it. Otherwise there are many other options available as well which give you better processor at this point.I will give more updates after one month of usage.. Thanks for scrolling this far and bearing with me.

If you want a Samsung phone under 40k.....go for it...you will not regret....4years security update (remember last one year we will get only 2 half-yealy update), 3 years of os update is cool, 12 5g bands, latest Snapdragon 778 processor, awesome camera under day light, mediocre under artificial light!Only cons is you get only 15w charger in the box even the phone supports 25w fast charging

I bought this phone for Rs.31,000. Trust me, I did no sorcerey neither I have any ""connections"". I bought it including 3,000 HDFC discount and the rest of Galaxy offers, no exchange offer is included whatsoever.Now, for the people saying it overpriced, well I totally believe its wrong! I mean you are paying merely 1k more than the Nord 2 for much superior support and longevity. I accept that the charger in the box is just 15 watts and the processor is slower than the Nord 2, but trust me it charges from 20 to 80 in 40 minutes, by no means as fast as Nord 2, but it certainly lasts longer as I own both of them. The processor though not as powerful, I did not faced any issue and most people won't too! I'm a power user and I am impressed by what it offers.Cameras and display, well its Samsung.. they are obviously a class apart.That's my honest review or rather my stand on the phone. Rest assured this phone will be in your pockets for much longer than other manufacturers'.

The difference between Samsung galaxy a52 and Samsung galaxy a52s 5g isone is 4g phone and other is 5g phone. The processor in a52 is Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G and in a52s is Qualcomm Snapdragon 778. And others features are same,But the price  difference between two phone is ₹10,000.So the a52s is over price. These phone Shouldn't buy at these prices range.

Classic piece of hardware from Samsung
","
I am no expert reviewer to get into the technicality of the hardware specs but I surely am among those millions of Indians who have certain expectations from mobile manufacturers to deliver in their product. So, does this phone deliver on all the key expectations? Yes and No.Let’s see what’s good and bad with A52s 5G and some of it also involves Samsung’s strategy to market this A series phone.Pricing: Samsung A series phones are targeted for offline markets and priced higher to cushion the channel costs but that key differentiation has vanished from the time consumers started to shift to online for better offers, discounts and exchange value for their old devices. With A52s 5G priced at 36K for 6/128 GB variant and the elder sibling S20FE 5G priced at 37K for 8/128 post bank discounts, many would blindly put their money on S20FE which is a much premium phone which comes with its own deficiencies. It clearly goes without saying that this phone is priced 5-6K higher for the specs offered and Samsung brazenly slashing the price on S20FE has made A52s less attractive to consumers on value for money scale.Design: It is a well-balanced phone weighing about 190 gms. Feels nice and fresh in hand. Back panel has matte finish and rejects fingerprints. Camera module has a bit of bump with nice curved edges. I didn’t feel the phone to wobble much while typing when kept on a flat surface. Side rails has chrome finish but finishing feels a bit cheapish. Front punch hole camera is tucked nicely in the middle under the display and looks neat with its small size. But the same may look a bit larger after you apply screen guard. A big plus point of this phone is the IP67 rating which forgives your occasional carelessness.Performance: With the latest 6nm SoC at the heart, this phone handles all day-to-day tasks with no sweat. A full day use on emails, social media, YouTube videos, few calls and there was still battery left to start the next day. I am no expert gamer but on occasional light gaming sessions I did not notice any heating. That way this processor is highly capable and well calibrated to handle 95% of the jobs that you put to it. Rest 5% is the demand for more raw processing power for high end gaming sessions which this processor may not fully deliver.Battery: The 4500 mAh battery stores enough juice to take you through one full day with heavy usage. With medium to light usage, it is a 1.5-2 days battery. 15W adaptive fast charger in the box takes 1 hr 38 mins to full charge. Idle battery drain during night is about 4% with no running apps. It used to be 3% on OneUI 3.1 but jumped up by 1% after software update to OneUI 4.Screen: Phone comes with an excellent quality Samsung AMOLED display. Viewing angles, Color reproduction on this screen is top notch. 120 Hz display gives a smooth scrolling effect but at the cost of higher battery drain. Fingerprint sensor underneath the screen could have been better. That’s one gripe that I have about this phone.Camera: Back quad camera setup produces some excellent shots in daylight. Regular, Portrait and Wide-angle shots are impressive. Low light shots are above average with OIS and Night mode helping you to capture shots with noise. Front selfie camera also produces some good images but misses out on Dynamic Range in some cases. Selfies are a bit soft but captures the edges quite well on portrait shots. There’s a small delay while switching between front and back cameras but that’s no concern.Audio: Stereo Speaker setup is loud enough and generates some good bass. It is a delight to listen to music over the speakers. Good addition is the 3.5mm headphone jack which is a blessing for gamers and those who wants to enjoy music without having to additionally invest on a pair of Bluetooth headphones or a dongle. Output from 3.5mm jack was good.Software: Phone came loaded with OneUI 3.1 out of the box and received OneUI 4 update within two days towards end of January. UI is buttery smooth and I really like some of the new features included in the new version. I have not been a big fan of Samsung UI from early days and that’s been one of the main reasons why I have avoided Samsung phones. OneUI is a huge leap from the UI I have used some 10 years ago. Cherry on the cake is Samsung’s commitment of 3 years of Android updates and 4 years of security updates on this phone.Future Proofing: It has been about a year that phone manufacturers have been using 5G as a marketing gimmick…even if it means their phones support only one or two 5G band. On the A52s there is no stinginess on the number of 5G bands. It is a truly global phone with 12 5G bands and more LTE bands than some phones in the same price range using Snapdragon processor.Other Basics: Call quality, Network reception is good. Call recording is possible through native calling app. Messaging app is from Google but you can change the default app under settings to use Samsung’s native messaging app. Supports 4G+ carrier aggregation. Proximity sensor works well. Does not come with FM Radio and neither did I see e-Compass.So, is that this phone is packed with all the goodness and nothing to gripe about? Not really. There are areas which Samsung could have improved on this phone for which they’re charging a premium. Let’s look at them one by one.In the box: It is time Samsung understands the Indian consumer mindset. A good quality back case, a pre-applied screen protector goes a long way in earning customer appreciation for the brand. Brand does not provide any case or screen protector (pre-applied or otherwise) with this phone. Though the phone supports 25w super-fast charging but what you get in the box is a 15w adaptive fast charger with a less than standard short charging cable. I was totally disappointed to see Samsung cutting corners on the essentials on a phone priced above 30K. On a lighter note, brands have started to offer 120W charging brick in the box with at least 1 meter charging cable and here we have Samsung supplying a 15W charging brick with a phone that supports 25W super-fast charging. In which universe is 25W known as super-fast charging which takes about 60 mins to fully charge the 4500 mAh battery. Customers may go out and spend another 2 grands to enjoy faster charging speeds and that’s exactly what Samsung wants. Samsung may argue their point that it is done to ensure longer battery life and less heating. Which may be true to some extent but not a fully reliable argument.Biometric (Fingerprint Sensor): It is a clear hit or miss case with under display fingerprint reader. It is very slow and % of success and unlocking the phone the first time is 75-25. It gets worse after you apply screen protector. There is settings to increase touch sensitivity but that doesn’t help much either. I have removed and added fingerprints few times but success % has not got any better. There are other methods being suggested to improve fingerprint reading but I cannot vouch for it as I have not tried it myself. Apart from the fingerprint sensor the touch sensitivity on the display is quite good and very responsive too.Bloatware: There are too many of them – both Samsung and third-party apps. I simply do not understand why a reputed brand like Samsung wants to tarnish its image in the lower premium and premium segments by preloading apps that may not be of interest to its customers. It is a task by itself as part of initial setup to make sure the Samsung apps are disabled so they don’t send notifications. I really don’t like it.Above are my observations after using this phone for 3 weeks and I wanted to put this out to help my fellow customers who have shortlisted A52s as their next phone. When I was going to buy this phone, I did not see any detailed review of it, hence I wanted to put this out.

Have been using this phone for last couple of days and it has been an excellent experience. The phone is smooth at 120 Hz and excellent transition between apps. The SD 778 processor is a beast and ensures there is no heating or lags. Overall very impressive hardware from a reputed brand. The software updates from Samsung are unmatched and there is no comparison with any other vendor. Hence, a wonderful package at a competitive cost. I would highly recommend it.

Worst device that I've used and worst support from Samsung
","
I bought this product in the month of September and within just two weeks of usage the phone stopped working, when I approached the service centre they said that the mother board is defective and I demanded for a replacement of the product which they turned down saying that they'll fix the product and give it back to me within a week. Now it's been a month and I have no clue on when I'm going to get my device back and what they are going to do to compensate me for the time and effort I had to put in to keep following up with their unresponsive team. I have contacted their ASM, DSM and wrote to the service head of India and the CEO's office, still they are not doing anything effective to help me other than asking me to wait. This is the worst service that I have seen from any company. Don't buy samsung devices, they are unreliable and their service is terrible.

Got this deal at 26500/- after all discount without exchange.Bit Overpriced, i think 22k-25k is best price. Nothing Special Samsung is charging high price due to their brand name.Camera is decent but macro mode is not good. Built of phone is plastic and side frame is also plastic. It feels a cheap phone without the back cover.Expected more on this price range.Battery is good giving 5-6hr screen on time and with 24hr on standby.Earpiece quality is not that great while taking calls. My old moto g7 is way better in terms of call quality.Everything is fine i will recommend it but at price of 22k to 26K max.

I did lots of research before buying this phone. I kinda wanted a compact phone in mid range budget with good decent OS and hardware. I was looking for A53 but then I saw A73 , A73 5G has same specs like this A52s same processor tbh. I don't know how new Samsung processor is in A53 5G but i wanted a headphone jack which wasn't present on A53. Although company provides with 15 watts charger trust me the slower the charging the max battery longevity , if you can't bear 15 watts you could buy 25 watts which barely makes much difference if you can't wait for your phone to get charged for little longer.I got one UI latest update and the phone is smooth as hell although plastic body but who cares since you are gonna use silicone case. For Silicone case i would recommend : Trueupgrade silicone case , it has fiber cloth lining which prevents scratches on the back side of phone and perfect cutouts (please use this cover if you wanna avoid back side scratches avoid hard cases)Last but not the least, this is the best choice than A73 or A53 for those who needs headphone jack if headphone jack is not your concern and you can opt for extra 500mah battery capacity with samsung processor then go for A53 or A73 without charger. OnE UI and good battery life is really good and am loving it.Was using Redmi note 10 pro it's a good phone but too bulky and big with its large screen.A52s 6.5 inches screen it seems compact to use that's what I liked about this , cheers (^o^)/

Hi everyone, I had bought this smartphone 5 months back for a super cool price with discount & exchange 👌Regarding the product-Firstly the shipping was fast but the packaging was not that good, but i received the product in a prestine condition except the plastic wrappers on the frame of the device were not present 😅-Build is sturdy, still feels a bit cheap and attracts finger print.-Display is really good with nice colour and good enough size. But even this model has black color cursh issue in few movies.-Stereo Speaker is really loud with good seperation.-My favourite 3.5 jack provides a really good experience for an audiophile too and the Dolby Atmos enhances that.-Battery life is nice for a full day average user. I get around 8+hrs of SOT. If i play games 5hrs.-Charging takes 1.45hrs to charge from 0-100%, which is enough for me.-Cameras on this is really an fabulous experience. I like how they present the photos n videos taken. They have good details and boosted colour but not overwhelming. Then OIS works while taking photos n in videos upto 1080p 30fps above this resolution EIS was provided through recent update. This might change in future updates. But so far loving the cameras.-Im was an user of Miui, I thought One Ui was hyped and was. Skeptical. But after using it for months I'm liking it a lot. Also the software is smooth and lag free with no bugs. Samsung pushes regular software updates including few QOL features.-Ram management is good can use 12 apps in background.-Storage is fast for daily use, but if used for transferring data it is slow.-Connectivity is awesome for mobile data with good dual 4g+ with great speed. But wifi range is not to my expectations.-Till this date the experience with phone call is great with no call drops. Speaker volume is really loud. And even though this lacks physics proximity sensor the virtual PS works nice for 90% of the time.-I don't play games that ofter. I did play few demanding games like ping n genshin impact for few weeks to check it's potential, all i can say is it is playable for an average gamer with medium graphics. But for pro gamers na😆. Because i see frame drops after 1.5-2hrs of continuous gaming. And the rear gets pretty warm as there is no dedicated cooling system used.-Huge disappointment for this mobile is the price. Even though I bought it for an unbelievably less price. I feel that for a SD778g this should be priced below 30k without any discount.Finally for me this smartphone checked all the features that i wanted along with really good software experience. And i really appreciate myself for purchasing this smartphone, because I'm really happy with this purchase 😃👍.The reason i reduced one 🌟 is because of price, cheap vibration motor, bit slow FP sensor, ufs2.1, no bumper case, no pre applied screen gaurd and mainly for not launching 256gb version in india 😉.I hope this my review helps few who are confused in purchasing this smartphone.Bye......😎

Being a One Plus 6 user, switching from this phone was very difficult choice, but still I chose to go with this phone and i was proven wrong at first instance itself. Let me begin what i didn't like about this phone.Pros:Built quality - Average with plastic body with gaps between the panel.Software response- very bad as i was having huge lag between switching over applications especially while calling and ending a call which One plus 6 was very responsive.Finger print response- AverageFast charging- AverageCamera- Ok, not as expected as i find pixels.Usability- AverageCons:Latest chipset underutilizedDisplay- GoodOverall verdict is that this is an old wine put in a new bottle. At this price, will recommend One Plus, Oppo or Vivo.Never buy this phone since I am planning to sell this phone.

So I bought the phone under without offer section for just 33,990 inr. Trick is to switch to without offer where u see with offer (which u can find under changing colours and ram configuration). Just make sure it's Amazon certified.Review:Overall a great phone, 778 performs awesome, matte black so no fingerprints, included cable is small and charger is just 15W even tho phone supports 25W, there is no adaptive refresh rate (it's just 120 or 60), also haptic motor is poop (I just turned it off), there is some bloatware but u can disable much of it, new to one ui so don't no much atm. If u get 8GB model for under 35k then only worth it...

 I used to like Samsung mobiles but this mobile Samsung A52 S has disappointed me due to the following:Over heating issue-It has overheating issues.It becomes extremely hot that you cannot even hold the phone on your hand.Camera:Photos are not coming good. The pics are not sharp and doesn't feel as natural.Even the videos when we try to share on whatsapp the volume doesn't work.Waste of money .When we call the Samsung Customer care team they will ask you to do many steps which won't give you any solution instead they will tell you to go to service centre.Price is very high its  worth is not more than 12000 Rs.Over priced phone. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE I NEVER EXPECTED THIS FROM A BRAND LIKE SAMSUNG.

Wanted a midrange phone with a relatively clean OS and a good 120Hz/90Hz screen. Was eyeing the M52 but when A52s became available for 28k (3k coupon, 6k credit card discount), decided to go with this one.Pros:- Great screen- 778g performs well. Haven't noticed any major stutters/lag. I haven't used it for any gaming.- Android 12 update has arrived- Relatively lightweight and handy- Good stereo speakers- Decent cameraCons:- Battery life is strictly average. Never finish the day with more than 25%- They claim quad cameras but 2 (macro and depth) are useless.- Plastic back and sides may be a concern from a durability perspective- Charger included in the box is 15W while the phone supports 25W

It's a good phone but coming from an older lg flagship, I just felt the experience quite lacking.What I liked -Great battery life.Great software, both performance and feature wise as well as in terms of update - this midranger was getting android 12 at Feb 2022 when even some phones launching at the time were not coming with it.Good displayStereo speakersWhat I felt was not good enough -Haptics are mediocre.Camera - It is pretty good. But no stabilization at 4k, no raw support, overall bad pics in challenging situations.. these were a deal breaker for me. My older lg v30 was doing better in many situations.Phone is really bulky especially with a case.Build quality is meh..And this is after buying the phone with a  heavy discount at around 25k. At full price I won't even bother.But still, I finally sold it and got s20 fe which I think is a better deal even though it's a bit old. Better go for previous flagships then newer midrangers. Just my take :)

I was I  the look out for a device to replace  my Galaxy S9 which handled my requirements very well for 3 years.I looked at S20FE but I felt the phone was a bit old and then seriously looked at Nord 2 but I some how didn't like the reviews it had and it did not have a IP rating which was a bummer for me.Also I looked at newer A53 but some how I still haven't gotten over 3.5 MM jack and then settled on A52S which ticked most boxes.I have been using it for a week,i liked the solid phone which Samsung has built for this price point.1.It has a decent processor with Snapdragon 778 over Exynos of A53(But Exynos in my earlier S9 also performed credibly).2.The UI after update to Android 12 and 4.1 looks good3.The battery life is decent ,they could have provided a 5000mah battery at this price point.I prefer slow charging over ultra fast charging so 15 w charger is fine r for me.I also activated the option to charge upto only 85 percent and also use AU battery app to extend battery life3.The cameras are good even though I am not a profilic camera user.4.The stereo sound quality is good,I bought a Boat 170 bluetooth speaker for listening to songs during work5.I don't know why Samsung installs so many unwanted bloatware but I am used to it.I know you get better specs for this price point with Chinese brands but some how I feel Samsung builds solid phones than them as I rarely visited  a Samsung service centre after using Samsung phones for the past 7 years.

Upgraded from a Samsung Note 4 after many years of good service. Samsung is a reliable brand and was happy to get this phone under 29K with my card offer. Was a little worried about getting a used or open box but no such issues. Only down side was a lack of silicone cover as one drop could dent or scratch the plastic frame. Charging is very decent and I don't use fast charging at all. I needed a 3mm jack for my music and addional a memory card option for my data, which was important for me. Hasn't become hot once in the last one week but Iam not a gamer so haven't pushed the phone hard and battery easily last one a half day. Extremely happy with this phone.

Bought this phone for ₹26,499 after offers and discounts.1. It's a typical android phone with nothing special.2. Phone is butter smooth (except games), 120Hz does it's job. Call of Duty lags at Medium settings with Max FPS, hence unplayable.3. Battery life is good. I am satisfied.4. Netflix doesn't support HDR on this device.5. Fingerprint sensor is pathetic, it doesn't detect your fingerprint  easily even at the time of setup.6. Stereo speakers are nothing compared to iPhone 11, but both these phones are not of the same competition so we can let this pass.7. Phone's build quality doesn't feel premium at all. Feels like a cheap plastic.8. Phone feels bulky.9. Cameras are average, don't expect much.Overall it's a plain cheap android phone. Not worth the price Samsung is asking for. I regret buying it.

Bought the 8 gb version at 30kIt is a well rounded product and got updated to one ui 4 recentlyProsOne UI 4 is the best out there , very smooth and simple to use no adds or junk ware unlike Xiaomi etc. Plus 3 OS updates are guaranteed by Samsung.Display is really good 120 hzCamera is best in this segment, OIS helps a lot in capturing toddlers who can't stay still for a moment. Potrait mode is great  night and macro are better than expected. (Camera is better than more expensive One plus/vivo/oppo phones)It has an official IP rating and can withstand water and dust, the phone alerts in case water has entered charging port and also when it's dry and safe to charge.Battery life is very good, very difficult to kill in a day. Getting SOT BTW 6 -8.5 hours.Performance is good no jitters in the past 2 months.ConsPlastic back could be better, it's solid but doesn't justify 30k+ tag.Needs a metal frame15 w Charger in box is painfully slow takes 1.25 hours to charge from 20-100, 25 watt charger will charge lot faster but needs to be bought separately.At 38k S20 FE will give a better Camera (so only buy if you get it within 32k)

I was confused between samsung A52s 5g and moto edge 20...and got a great discount of ₹6000 on the former. I will mention some pros and cons to justify my review. Its been 14 days of rigorous use and the experience has been quite upto expectation.Pros-1) great camera setup. It handles most of the situation quite well.2) ip 67 waterproofing is also great for this price.3) build quility is very premium. You get the benefit of the extra price.4) 3.5 mm headphone jack. ( It has become a feature now a days)5) great display with great stereo speakers. Absolutely love the crispness of the speakers.6) Nice UI. It's not the core ui which is used in m series samsung phones . Its the premium ui which the company uses for its premium lineup.Cons-1) Even though the ui is great there's still some bloatware.( But Samsung promises to remove those in future update😁)2) the camera sometimes blows out the highlights like crazy.3) the fingerprint sensor is bit slow. Even after I disabled the animation, it still feels slow.4) No adaptive refresh rate mode. Either you stay on 120 hz or 60hz ( this is much needed )5) Even though the phone supports 25 watt charging , it has got 15 watt power brick in the box. Even the much cheaper m51 has 25 watt charger in box.6) The ois is not great. Even the EIS is better than this.But overall the cons are heavily outnumbered by the pros...and you also get the samsung brand as security which is very reassuring.

Apart from cluttered ui and slow fingerprint reader, everything else is bang on buck
","
Review after about 2 weeks of usage:Cons first:Coming from Oxygen OS, One UI is a bit difficult to navigate and also has some irritating bloatware, but you can disable almost all of them.Displaying Network speed not supported by default, you need third party software to do same.You have to press hardly on fingerprint sensor for about one whole second to get it unlocked.Charging capacity is pocked at 25w, so takes about an hour and some minutes to fully charge such a big battery.Speaker sounds could have been better, even with stereo speakers still less sound.Display does not have hdr certification or support, so netflix and prome runs normal videos instead of HDR.Pros:Good and bright display, smooth lag free experience, Android 12, good one whole day battery backup with moderate usage.

Excellent premium flagship phone worthy for every buck spent

A52S 5G (6gb/128gb) is a flagship phone with crisp display, excellent camera performance & super build quality.. The phone is with RAM plus technology (ram is virtually increased by extra 4 gb) & 12 bands 5g & also guaranteed to receive 3 Android upgrades along with 4 years security updates.. so a great phone expected to serve for many years (at least 5-6 years without any lag in performance).. the fingerprint sensor is working in zip even with the.pered glass protector.. highly recommended.. I like to thank specially to Amazon & the seller Cosmic byte for fast delivery & adequate packaging of the phone..  the phone is superb & the seller is highly recommended.

Nothing is special but good for parentsCons:1.Battery life max 7 hrs2.cheap built not feel like 30k phone feels like 20k phone3. Chip is basic4.sound quality is not great5.camera need light to give good great photos otherwise it sucksPros:1.A series samsung pay,clean 4.0 1ui,smooth 120 hrtz disply work smoothly.2.No over heating,not hang or lag.3.super smooth withb120hrts feels like oneplus oxygen OS very addictive display4.Waterproof phone5.Good for long term use because of 4 years of updates by Samsung &  official service centres.6.If you are previous samsung user you amazed 30% only,you feel super over priced with lack of battery life & lack of 25 watt charger and metal back. If you are new for samsung have a patience to learn phone features it was really a good phone you amazed by 100% after some weeks.5.Network call quality is good no issue with that airtel with sim1 work really good.Conclusion:1. I buy without offer phone i feel no diffrence but box is open not phone box, phone box is sealed well but amazon internal carboard box open and i also brought giftcart backcover amazon insert that back cover inside open carboard and sealed with regular amazon cover i feel no differnce with and without offer phone.2.Update the current security update ,then again press at software updates it update it self its before / previous months security updates at janaury you got 2 gb of 4.0 one ui update.3.Battery life is only matters to you its actully  a good phone.If you are confusing with Chinese phones including OnePlus i recommending you to go with Samsung,even M series phones better than OnePlus.4. Samsung A52s 5g  (snapdragon chip) phone is much better than its updated A53 phone or go with S series fe20 because Exynos sucks.5.Good for heavy use, because of battery its not for heavy use,good for professional use no lag of hang.6.Good for long term use because of complete waterproof & 4 year's of security updates.

Over priced by 10k
","
Got it for ₹28500 in Jan 2022 sale after SBI card discount of 6k. Device is working fine given mint condition as of now. Amazon didn't have the nice colours on sale (got the black one), which was a bummer. 120 hz looks nice, but somehow juddery maybe the page doesn't load as fast as the display refreshes. LTPO would have been nice for the price. Bixby for some odd reason tends to launch on its own. Received Android 12 update immediately within a week. OS skin is solid, and coming from stock Android, must say Samsung has improved by leaps and bounds. Camera is decent. However, FE model has both better display & camera.

Got 8GB variant in offer

I don't know how it went, I had purchased during year end sale with 5000 seller offer and 6000 ICICI card offer making the price to 26K which was a steal. For a person coming from moto phone line want OS to be minimal. So uninstalled all the bloatware's. Photos looks realistic than MI and thats why I opted samsung. My choice from motto was either go to IPhone or Samsung. After various reviews I decided to go with android again. Camera is a point with iphone but I will be too nervous to carry such a costly product. Also will be missing some features like amoled display,full display without notch, USBC, finger print etc. Coming to samsung A series have priority for update and all with other premium series of samsung. It mostly align with M series, but have preference over M in matters such as update.

Problem after update
","
The phone seems Ok, but I had a bad experience. I purached it for my wife. After few  days the new updates came for the phone. I updated it. On the restart it was asking for password. There was no password set for the phone. But we had set this fingerprint and pattern. Still it was asking for it. We tried with 000 and 000000 the default ones and still no luck. Finally I had to factory reset and wipe all the data and start from the scratch. So I request everyone to set a password for this one.

The phone is fast. Good audio clarity,decent camera. Samsung could have given atleast 6000 mAh battery.

Its not an overpriced phone

Samsung is one of the best smartphone brand...and it is giving a52s 5g  8/128 varient in 34k now. And giving you 12 5g bands as one plus nord 2 gives only 5 5g bands and SD778 is far better than mediatek dimensity 1200... You can do better gaming in Samsung a52s 5g.And it also doesn't heat up after 1-2 hours of gaming it only feels a little warm... One plus has only 50mp main camera but a52s has 64 mp camera so you will definitely get better photos... Youtubers says its OIS is working half but i received update after 3-4 hours and Samsung has fixed this..one plus nord 2 has 90hz FLUID display not amoled display but a52s 5g has 120hz full HD+ amoled display...and Samsung is giving you 3×OS updates that means you will have android 12,13 and finally android 14 in this phone... I am saying that except apple and samsung mostly every smartphone brand is just launching smartphones saying I am giving this I am giving that... Yes you are giving but what about post services... These kinds of Chinese Brands like - XIAOMI,POCO,REALME they only launch phone but doesn't give any updates after 8-9 months yes literally 8-9 months and there are also too many bugs in these phones and the UI of these Chinese brands is a garbage...and Samsung one UI is the best... Its also giving you IP67 water and dust resistance and that's awesome and its in display fingerprint sensor is awesome...Tip- if you feel fingerprint sensor slow then turn off the animation.Conclusion-""If you are thinking its overpriced then think what Samsung is giving other brands can't do that"".Thanks for reading this all this and this is the one of the best smartphone for me you should buy this.

Nice phone, poor fingerprint reader
","
This phone of Samsung, belonging to the much elite A series, is comparatively a better phone. However, the fingerprint reader js very disappointing. Unlike the other phones in which the reader is on the power button, this optical, in-display, fingerprint reader is very slow and one has to try 3-4 times to for it to succeed. Rest, I am happy with the phone.

Average phone but premium cost

After using this for few months, I understand that this phone is overpriced, NO ufs 3 or higher rom, they have not mentioned it in anywhere, any one can assume that under this price range, samsung must provide ufs 3 or higher rom but it's not true. Battery life is average, camera quality is good in day light but under low light or artificial light, quality suffers. Processor is very good, no doubt, app optimization is, I felt, good but they always give some unnecessary apps, a clean android menas clean android. There is another big issue is touch issue, normal use has zero problem, butter smooth, but while gaming, if sweat occures in ur finger, obviously it will appear, then u'll mis the touch response, u'll loose control over in-display joystick. Otherwise zero lag but touch issues while gaming if sweat occures.

Galaxy A52s 5G- Made for Awesome!!

The Galaxy A52s 5G is a direct rival to the OnePlus Nord 2 5G. Though many were coaxing me to buy the Nord 2 I went for this one with utter trust in Samsung.

2 months honest review! read before you buy!
","
Following is my first hand experience after 2 months of usage. I ordered 6g/128gb black color variant.Looks:Its okay not that wow factor which a 30k phone will have, the side panels will disappoint you for sure because they are chrome polished similar to samsung old phones(j5 etc) and when you put the phone inside the cover that shine will definitely attract scratches and make the phone look older in no time.Battery:Awesome.Camera:Samsung always enhances the view with 1 tone brighter colors and this phone is no different.Also one thing which really irritated me was the white button which is given to  take the pic, 90% of the times I see two overlapping white touch buttons coming to take pictures. That looks really third class as if you are holding a sub 10K phone. May be a software update might fix that bug.Overall the picture quality is better than what you get in the competition within same range.Performance:not a hard core gamer but just to test this phone I played many arcade and racing games and there was no lag or hang problem as such. Browsing is also smooth and lag free.Finger print sensor:Runs on luck i guess, sometimes it opens quickly but most of the times it takes min 2 seconds or may be 2-3 attempts also to open. (I read this same problem in some other review also).Note that I have three brand phones(samsung, redmi, apple) currently under use. I will any day recommend this over any redmi phone of this range. Redmi phones feel flimsy against this. However, it can not be as smooth as the apple.Hope this helps!!

Could have been better

Could have been better!Pros:ScreenChipsetOverall user experience3 years major OS upgrade promise. Already received android 12.IP67 protectionCons:Camera is old GW1 sensor also available in not so expensive Samsung phones.Night photos are not great as mentioned in some reviews however that could be because outside India they have used Sony sensor.Dual speakers don't produce good sound; forget about loudness.Battery backup is average, considering AMOLED screen and 5 NM CPU, normal usage will manage one day however if you plan to consume content or play even simple games then it will not be enough.No dynamic screen refresh rate option, only 60 or 120Hz option. So if you use to plan 120Hz then the battery will drain faster.HeavyOver in all I will say it's a good phone but could have been better considering the price and brand name.

Lives upto the expectation
","
Well a pretty good product by Samsung, if you dont have too much expectations. I have been using this phone from last 15 days and can tell you about my experience.Pros:-The camera quality is Good as always (as it is Samsung).Display is FHD+ sAMOLED. Dual Stereo speakers works fine. Comes with 3.5 mm jack ( a feature to notice nowadays 😅). There is no connectivity issue.With SD 778 the overall performance of this phone is decent, as it is combined well with Samsung's One UI. Plus it has 12 5G bands.Cons:The battery backup is a bit low as it gives you 6- 9 hrs of screen On time depending on the usage, but that is not a thing of concern because if you normally use it , it can give battery backup of 1 day or a bit less than that.The price of this smartphone is its biggest Con, but if you wait for the right time and buy this phone in sale that too under 30k, its worth it.So, overall it lives up to the general expectations, and worth a try.

I have started using iPhone from 5 series and since then this is 7th iPhone which I upgrade and I must say till date this has got the best battery I have observed in any of my previous iPhones. Camera quality you can’t even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don’t need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it’s gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it.

Writing after one week of usage. I switched from Samsung A50 (light and good quality. was very happy)All good and enough reviews are there online. Pro max is bulky.

I love everything about the 13 pro max. From the gloriously bright and vibrant display to the enormous battery life. This phone does it all. Seriously, and the cameras? Bloody brilliant. Highly recommend the 512gb and up for those interested in prores video recording. Is it expensive? Bloody yeah but worth every penny.

Best Battery. Best Camera. Very smooth. But not value for money.

Switched from Android to iPhone. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.

The iPhone 13 Pro Max’s stellar cameras, 120Hz ProMotion display and longer battery life add up to a practically perfect phone in our testing.

1st thing 1st... Look -- Very good looking phone and feel premium when you hold it.A refresh rate of 120Hz is good to feel on 13 pro max. Camera quality is just superb, pics from 13 pro max looks more real as compare to other premium segments which are using more AI and color combinations. Battery life is also outstanding, with normal use a fully charged can go up to 2 days.  Very smooth and fast performance. Just go for it.

The phone is amazing if u have an iPhone 12 dont upgrade unless you want to experience 120hz wait for the next model. My first time using IOS took sometime to get used to but definitely worth it. Miss a few android things but definitely not complaining. Wish apple reduces the price XD. The phone definitely lives upto its mark. Definitely go for it but definitely make the most of the offers when available.

Any phone around 60k-50k can do all the stuff this phone can do and more, if going for Chinese brands ,then even at 30-40k you will get very good phones which has better or same display battery backup almost same good camera  !!

HiPlease consider this message with a serious note the One Plus 9R which was bought on the above mention date got hanged and did not open exactly on the 13th day of buying it. The replacement policy was only for 10 days and my phone showed prblms from the 13th day. I took it to the One Plus Care Centre and they said it needed an update i waited for 3 days for the 'So Called' update to arrive but after 3 days the Care Centre informed me that this phone needed a Motherboard change when i ask them to replace the phone, they said that the care could not replace it for a new one because i had bought from amazon. They are now suggesting to replace it through amazon only. Is this what i bought a 40k One Plus phone for? If i can only tag the Oneplus company people in this!!!!!What kind of mobile phones do they sell???And also i want to claim a replacement of my phone from Amazon....i just dont care if the 10 days return policy is over....

Dear Buyers,I bought this phone for my younger brother as his birthday gift. I was outside the city when I got this delivered to him. He was facing issues with this phone from the first day, but he didn't inform me since I gave him a gift and didn't feel like complaining about a gift. It's only after I met him I came to know that :1. This phone has serious heating issues. Gets so much hot while charging that a human hand can't hold it.2. Battery Draining issue. The battery doesn't last more than 5 hours after 100% charge with normal to low usage. If you keep the phone and stare at the battery percentage, you can actually see it going down in front of your eyes.3. Overrated camera. The amount paid for this phone doesn't justify the quality of the cameras, and the entire thing is overrated.4. I would clearly recommend buying an iPhone 11 instead. Way better battery life, camera, durability and software experience.I tried returning the phone immediately, but amazon did not accept the return and asked us to run some tests. On running the test they advised that the phone is perfect and we might be not using it right. Beautiful isn't it? And now we are stuck with this worthless heating brick.

Please don't go for it as there are lot of other good smartphones in the market with same set of features for 40k. Big no from my side. One plus Nord is better than this and I would recommend One plus should call back entire.  9R series.

Wonderful phone for the price.

As I'm a OnePlus user for more than 4 years now I purchased the OnePlus Plus 9 Pro on 30th March and loved it.And got the 9R for my sister and she loved this phone.I would say it's better to get 9R over 9 else buy the 9 Pro.Camera on the 9R is not as people are saying that it's bad. It's decent for the price. A normal person can't tell the difference btw.Screen is beautiful, phone looks premium.

Camera  and battery not really good

Camera is not really great, battery draining too fast,i didn't expect this from one plus, loudspeaker for calls is not so high ,u can't listen if there is disturbance outside, but speaker for music is awesome effect, need to improve many things, battery is heating too much while using camera or for using in hot sun, u should improve this,if u lift ur phone from rest,all mobile shows fingerprint scanner to unlock,but one.plus is not showing that ,u should double tap or press the lock but it annoying for this, typing has also become difficult for me compared to my old mobile, sliding is also not good if u use this while texting, first it was to take about 50min to charge fully,now after 4 5 days it's taking 30 35min

Very poor overall performance

Initial review after 2 days of use.Look and feel is great.Function smoothly without any lag.Faced heating issues even if slightly overloaded, big disappointment.Warp charge works very well, however battery is draining faster than usual.Camera is good on first impression, yet to explore more.Overall, doesn't looks like a good deal considering the price.---------------------------------------------Further reduced the rating to 2 star after extensive use of 2 months.1. Phone keeps heating even while not in use and background app restricted.2. Phone heats while charging and disable many features until temperature comes down.3. Hassalebald has only given name, seems like just another ordinary camera.4. Charging was good initially but after updates it takes more than an hour to fully charge.A basic 15k smartphone can be easily compared to this so called flagship killer. Strongly not recommended to buy.

 Bought OnePlus 9R after seeing good online reviews but all reviews seems biased. After using 2 weeks, my review is OnePlus 9R is Average phone. Was earlier using Poco F1 for 2 years so comparing with Poco F1.Built quality OK but no premium phone feeling. Battery backup 6-7 hrs with normal office use but charger is quite fast 40minutes full charging. Camera is poor specially in night, camera quality is of 10000 phone. Minor heating problem during heavy use like gaming or major download but not deal-breaker. User interface is good, no unwanted pre-installed apps. But you get 90-100 GB storage due to pre installed system apps. Screen resolution is good,touch is quite smooth, no lagging or hanging. Stereo speaker is OK but not best. Phone weight is OK. 4G speed is slightly better in this phone, no call drop felt. But I don't find Wao factor (between Poco F1 vs OnePlus 9R. Sometimes Poco F1 is better. So if someone is not Jabra OnePlus fan then should look for other options also in 35000-40000 range. Vivo X60 camera is great. Mi phones are also good.

Review (8GB):This phone has very good performance. I ordered lake Blue its looking Stunning. love the device.Pros:=> Great performance/speed for SD 870 processor=> Battery life is fine=> Gesture control, Finger print scanner is nice=> Good cover provided with the phone, that really helpsCons:=> Heating while charging the phone. May be because of fast charge effect, OnePlus should look into this. After 100% charge, it automatically get cooled. no heating issueAs others are complaining there is=> No display tint issues=> No heating issues while using the phone, gaming etc. But noticed while charging=> No charging issues, within 10-15 mins 60-70% chargingRear Camera is good.

Issues with One plus 9

This is the first time I am very disappointed with One Plus. We have three One Plus models and were very happy with the build, performance , camera etc. But this time One Plus 9 series disappointed. Firstly, heating issues and while switching on the mobile for first time the touch was not working at all.

Review after 3 weeks of usage
","
The only reason I went for Oneplus 9R is that I have been using Oneplus 5T from last 3+ years, the phone is perfectly fine till now and I always wanted to go with Oneplus for the upgrade after using Oneplus 5T and for its great user experience.Coming to the Oneplus 9R, I am not totally satisfied with the phone as I had higher expectations on Oneplus 9R. With the given features and upgrades I feel the phone is not doing so great. When you compare this phones with the similar range of phones from other brands you will have different opinions and thoughts.Pros:- Display quality is very good, with Fluid AMOLED Display and 120 Hz refresh rate display it is buttery smooth- Built quality is great, with aluminum body and Front and back Gorilla Glass 5 protection. Feels premium in hand- Phone speakers are doing well, sound is crisp, loud and with more details- Handset microphone is also great, Can hear the exact voice of the caller and it's clear and loud- Performance - Qualcomm 870 Chipset is doing well, phone is running smooth with no lags so far.- Front camera is good if you compare with other 16MP sensors on other phones.- As usual clean UI experience with Oxygen 11 OS.Cons:- Minor heating issues.  Felt phone was heating up during initial setup, while moving the files from old phone to new one. first 2-3 days felt phone is getting warmer with normal usage aslo and during the time of charging. I feel the heating issues resolved after receiving the first OS update or who knows the phone might be settling down after few days of usage.- Primary camera(s) is not up to the mark, photos can be seen only better in pro mode, videos are little better and front camera is OK. Lots of additional and unnatural colors are being added to the shot. There is no much clarity when you zoom and no details and images are scattered. Camera is not good with the hype which Oneplus created.  I wish Oneplus would be able to fix the camera issues with some good updates if hardware supports and if not then that's it.-Battery backup - Battery drains very quickly with the 120Hz refresh on, battery lasts only for 1 day with full charge and optimal usage. But the good thing is, it charges very quickly as well with 65W Warp charger. from 6 to 100 % took 49 minutes to charge.Overall, if you want to go with the display and performance other then Camera quality and some other issues which I highlighted, then you can go for it and if you are an Oneplus fan.NOTE: Whoever wants good Camera, they might think twice before purchasing this phone. You will get way better camera phones than Oneplus 9R under 40K (38 with discount).

One plus lost its credibility after one plus 9 release.One plus 9 is only hype and worth for the money you pay .One plus 9 is having plastic body like other substandard mobile in the market .One plus 9 does not have wireless charging for only products available in India .One plus is having only two cameras where as one plus R and one plus is having four cameraOne plus 9 is having 5G band - only two 5G bands. The customer care has been fooling us that it will upgrade to 4 5G band.

It's a blunder from OnePlus
","
OnePlus did a blunder with this one. Battery quality is very bad. And it's charging very slow. I'm not sure it's some unit problem or software issue, so I've requested a replacement, but it states over 1 hour to full charge when it's already charged 60%. The charging rate is very low as well, and battery deplete very fast, I can say it depletes faster than it's charging rate.Screen quality is great.Sound quality isn't very good either, it has very less max volume, I literally had to keep it at full volume always for a decent sound.As for heating issues, as everyone else is stating, it's over heating a lot! While normal usage it overheats, let alone any power playing.Honestly, I feel OnePlus made a blunder here. I was really looking forward to this device. Let's see how the replacement unit feels.Edit - battery seem to be performing better after replacement. However, still have issues like overheating and speaker sound.

Feel like I lost another 40k 😭😭😭So called 65W fast charging -- in around 35mins only 25% chargeHeating issue just after 10 min usage - error message popsup while taking photos .. heating issues  - couldn't capture at all..Camera quality -- way below average ....Don't know what else to say...

One plus is always good in terms of performance, display and charging. This model is marvellous in terms of charging speed. Battery backup is decent when you are using 120 Hz refresh rate. OS is very clean but you will not get many customised option as it is like a stock android. Call recording function is useless but it is privacy policy u can't blame OP for this.Camera is not as hyped by OP , hasselblad is ordinarily working. Still camera is good enough since last versions. May be future updates will do much better as hardware specifications are good enough. Front camera is ok type they must have given atleast IMX 586 in that. At this price, when u are getting SD 888 , very fast charging, Sony IMX 689 and 766 sensors, this price is good. But they should have given OIS, more 5G bands.People say that wireless charging should be given like in overseas versions. What is the use 15 watt or 30 watt wireless charging when you getting 65 watt charging. Wired charging is much quicker than wireless. So wireless charging under 30 watt will be worst.Vivo X60 or Pro may be better in terms of camera but still they are using SD 870 only. Just 33 watt charging. They are using Sony IMX 598 only.  Somewhere you are getting better but u can't beat this in terms of batter charging and performance.No heating issues I have faced when used this almost 3 hours. Design is ordinary dont look like a flagship, Color is good. Extremely light weight and handy to use.It is good to buy.

Flagship Killer

First things first the display is awesome with excellent brightness, Camera is top notch with 8k recording at 30fps and 4k recording at 30 & 60fps. 4500mah Battery is a beast and charges within 20mins atmost and it lasts easily for about 24hrs for a normal usage. I used the mobile for a whole day for gaming,video recording,with mobile data & WIFI on alternatively and still after 24hrs battery balance is 37% . Multi Threading is ultra smooth in this mobile as mine is 12/256 gb version and neva gets slow in any circumstances. These are so far my observations for the past 3days of my mobile usage. As of now there are no flaws with this, will update if any. Final verdict is flagship killer,if you can afford dont look back n  go for it...

Read this review before choosing between OP-9 , Rog and IQOO
","
Hey .Today I'm gonna review the Oneplus 9 5G .Ask me any questions you have directly , and I'll try to answer them all. 🙏Okay so let's start :The phone looks quite good , its thin but a bit less wide , I use an iPhone 12 Pro Max , and it's around 1-2 cm less wide . Not a big issue .Screen is fluid , no problems at all . I have used oneplus 7T so I've trust over this brand .Battery :The 65 watt charger does what it's meant to . The cable is a USB C To C . Not the old usb to C . Charges in around an hour .Camera :In my opinion , the biggest selling point is the camera here . Looks good , with a tinge of extra saturation . Way better than the older ones . Gives a lot of independence too .PUBG :ALot of people buy oneplus devices for games , and comparing to my iPhone , this device gives a good competition . 90 fps is an advantage over apple , but rarely devices give 90 fps , maybe in tdms but not in classics . No lag , but you will see some frame drops , but which device doesn't have frame drops ! Even the iPhone does .Competitors :I needed to purchase this for my mother , so Need to share why I went for this .There's IQOO , Asus and Oneplus in this range which are worth buying . I have been using one plus so I trust them more , they have a local service center too , something which I lack in my iPhone experience .I don't trust vivo much , IQOO is a developing brand , it's op for sure , but still couldn't gamble . The Oneplus gives better cameras than any other , which is the main reason I got this , as camera usage is a lot .People with similar budget with just gaming budget can go for rog , but if you need a family phone , this guy packs nearly everything .*You also get stickers and a red cable club card , which is something I like .CONS :Oneplus really needs to deal with the software issues . There's always some thing left to patch after the release , which sucks .The dialer has that annoying annoucement during recording , and that really can make you go deaf XDOverall , could go for rog if needed a gaming phone , but since a lot of my family members use this device , I went for one plus .Thanks for reading , I hope I helped you :)

I HAVE PURCHASED ONEPLUS 9 MOBILE after being a satisfied experience of using One Plus 3 for four years.HOWEVER, this time the experience is bitter.Please find the chronology of incidents since I purchased said One Plus mobile phone• 27th April 2021 – Purchased One plus 9 through Amazon.• 28th April 2021 evening – Configured the phone.• 29th April 2021 – Could sense battery drain problem.• 30th April 2021 – Connected with service center, Checked battery performance by Self Diagnostic tool available in mobile. Wish to emphasis that the self diagnostic tool had declared battery problem on second day of purchase. EVIDENCE FOR SAME IS AVAILABLE.• 1st May 2021 – connected with service center on phone, I was asked to visit physically to service center.• April to June 2021 – On account of COVID, physical visit to service center was not poosible.• 17th July 2021 – visited service center with due appointment from portal, I was asked to download / have backup and admit the mobile for repair.• 17th July 2021 – Admitted the phone to service center, I have left with embarrassing situation in spite of purchasing expensive phone of good brand.• Wish to bring to your attention that, If the battery drain problem was detected by inbuilt tool of the phone within few hours of use, It is surely a manufacturing defect.AND IN CASE OF MANUFACTURING DEFECT, LOCALLY AND GLOBALLY, ALL THE COMPANIES JUST GIVE FREE REPLACEMENT IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT ARGUMENT.• I EXPECTED THE SAME FROM ONEPLUS, HOWEVER, REGRET TO MENTION, THE EXPERIENCE IS NOT EXPECTED FROM ONEPLUS IN A VERY UNAMBIGIOUS SITUATION / CLEAR MANUFACTURING DEFECT.• I DON’T WANT TO USE REPAIRED PHONE FOR NO DEFECT OF MINE WITHIN FEW HOURS.I HAVE DECIDED TO DEAL THE MATTER SERIOUSLY.REQUEST YOUR INTERVENTION FOR FREE & QUICK REPLACEMENT / REFUND COMPLETE AMOUNT AT THE EARLIEST.ELSE, COMMUNICATE BACK QUICKLY THAT YOU DON’T AGREE TO REFUND / REPLACEMENT.

Review after days of extensive use!
","
Review after 7 days of extensive usage. • I would say the performance you are going to get one oneplus and that OxygenOS touch you gonna get from knowhere. It's too smooth to handle after using this you'll find thise ""IOS"" devices are lagging cuz they aren't having 120 Hz display even the price for iphone 12 is almost double the price of oneplus 9R.Pros: • Snapdragon 870 which is smooth as hell either it be for video editing and redndering or it be for playing games. Even the ""Call of Duty"" runs like water buttery smooth at max fps. • Tested this device while playing games on it like COD/Free Fire with max Resolution and FOS and would say thermals are very good it won't heat up after almost an hor of gaming temp was still maintained to be as 40°C in a Non AC room. • Video Stability and recording best in the market if you turn night mode on even in the dark scenes it is well lit up no one can guess it was shooted in night. Video potrait is best for content creater the bokeh effect is mouth watering for the content creators the bokeh youll get is as similar as you'll get in a dslr camera but the surrounding should be well lit up. • Oxygen OS it is the best operating system I've seen on an Android device unlike other OS available for Android. • User interface is best thing of oneplus devices you can't get rid of it's addiction even you'll start hating IOS 😅 not actually but it's the best UI I've ever used • You'll get 5g support so you don't need to worry about future upgrades. This will work smooth. • Design and placement of Camera Module is the best the oneplus have done ever while it's completely subjective, but youll get 🦍 Glass 5 protection on front and back along with a aluminum chasis/side frame it's a well built device simply rigid and feels premium to hold. • Haptic is best in the price range. • Dua Dolby Stereo Speakers make it loud enough to consume your content at any place • Full day power just in few minutes this device comes with a 65W wrap charge which will charge your device in just the time span of 30/35 mins. You'll never fall short of power either it be powerful performance or the power interms of battery. • Oneplus's Fluid Amoled display is best screen I've ever seen smooth responsive and vivid best for Netflix, lovers xD.Cons: • There are some bugs oneplus need to solve it as it isn't justified for this kind of flagship devices. I'm mentioning few of them oneplus pls act accordingly. • While using YouTube  the framerate drops I don't know it's a google fault or what but even the notification bar seem to be freezing while scrolling down as to like 90fps. There are few more applications like Google photos application which I've discovered uptil now. • Phone get warms outside it might be due to the electronic devices catch too much of heat radiations from Sun rays. • Oneplus pls provide One-Hand mode as soon as possible as the device is having a large form factor it's quite not possible for using the device single handedly even if I am having really large palms and long fingers indeed, I am just thinking anout those girls having small cute palms and fingers💅🤣😅. • Now jumping to camera section one plus needs to work on the picture capturing algorithm the problems faced were like... • 1) Sometime captures undersaturated photos in potrait and 2x Zoom mode. • Need to work on the algorithm of focusing as it hunts for focus sometimes in the darker. • Basically Camera needed to be well optimized by oneplus in few aspects rather say camera performance is awesome just few bugs are needed to be solved. I've attached few pictures you can refer to those.Conclusion: • If you want a well built phone with best processing speeds and Video Capabilities you can opt for it it's is the best device in my terms under 50k budget but few bugs and improvisation are required & I hope Oneplus will donit sooner or later.Thanks for reading my review.

The OnePlus 9R is a fair proposition in terms of the phone's pricing. For Rs 39,999, I get great performance, along with a very fluid and clean software experience. The photography, especially in low light, might not be spectacular, but it's still pretty good. Fast charging, decent battery life, and an attractive design contribute to the OnePlus 9R being a great purchase decision.

Read this Before a YouTuber review: Honest review after 1 month of usage.

Cons:1- Don't purchase if you can't afford an AC and it's bill 24*7. All phones with SD 888 have same heating issues. See if you can wait until SD 895 or Andriod 12 (early development says it consumes 20% less battery so may have less heating issues). It heats while Playing games or normal use even in AC ( Yes, I'm not kidding). You may have to optimize all apps in battery optimization but then there's no use of such great hardware as after optimising, apps behave weird in background.2- No OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) at this price. OnePlus has not done the homework correctly.3- Same - Old front camera sensor. OnePlus would need to do better, but it is doing better for it's lower segment phones with introducing better sensor in Nord 2. It feels like OnePlus 9 users who paid more got cheated.4- Touch was smooth for 1st 10 days, but now it sometimes behave abnormal for which I am concerned.5- Build quality is not at all Premium, I mean even 10k phones can look great but if the material used is cheap what shit are you selling your customers at such huge price.Phone uses a nice looking plastic but at the end, it's plastic and definitely at this price gives no justice to its price.Pros - Portrait mode video shoot with back camera is cool if you are a content creator.Game graphics are great. Like you'll have UHD, extreme in Pubg. But at the same time heating and touch issue does no justice to that.Conclusion - I think this phone is worth 25k -30k max with the kind of material they've used to build it, having same front camera sensor and having such heating issues which you would feel in low budget phones.Don't watch YouTube reviews. Most reviews are sponsered, and most youtubers lack real hardware,software understanding.

888 is way too fast.65 watt charging is awesome.120hz display is buttery smooth.Ram and Storage are also very fast.Rear cameras are awesome, best in this price segment.Front camera is very average (didn't liked it).Battery backup is also average, but the charging speed cover it all. If you're a moderate user you will get whole day backup.Oxygen OS is just amazing. It's the cleanest UI I've ever used and have lot of customization features too..No heating issue faced till now, it just became a little warm(very little) in booting. Other than that I played Asphalt 9 and COD mobile they were buttery smooth.Final rating from my side 9/10. ( One marks less coz take a lot of selfies but selfie camera turned out to be a disappointment for me).Go for it, awesome device, you will love using it.

 I bought this one plus 9 phone on October 4th at Amazon Products.  I never expected such a crappy phone to come from such a great company .. which has more demerits than merits ..About my experience on performance & quality:1) The phone hangs most of the time during call and not even able to pickup or disconnect the call2) Hangs with background app activities.3) Camera quality is average like the standard comes at a 20k phone.3. Overrated camera. The amount paid for this phone doesn't justify the quality of the cameras, and the entire thing is overrated.4. I would clearly recommend buying an iPhone 11 instead. Way better battery life, camera, durability and software experience.I tried returning the phone immediately, but amazon did not accept the return and asked us to run some tests. On running the test they advised that the phone is perfect and we might be not using it right. Beautiful isn't it? And now we are stuck with this worthless heating .Price is all time high.As per build quality and performance, it should be priced 30k.Battery drains faster. Drains with in few  hours of usage, Camera quality is very poor and worst experience... I didn't expect that much bad quality.The product just overheating.. it is unbelievable from such great company production devices. Here the cost does not matter but product quality is matters.Please do not deceive customers like me with things like this. Again I do not want to buy a phone from this company.t thankyou..

AFTER ONE MONTH REVIEW1.Camera is great.I)OIS is not an issue as youtubers were saying.2.Neither overheating, temperature remains as it is on other devices it's just software glitch on apps like ampere3.gaming is so smooth that you will need few days to get used to (Cod Mobile,Pes2021,Kof, Pokemon go) even if you're pro.4.80percent battery can last 4-5 hours screen on time and 8-10 hours otherwise.5. Stereo speakers are good6.Screen quality is far better than previous OnePlus devices, Looks like samsung device from front because of samsung screen.7.Price is 6k -8k higher Just because of hasselblad logoOverall great phone go for it

Beast with a cute look

I have an OnePlus 3 and an One plus 8 and this this my third purchase of an oneplus phone in the family.A bit disappointed to hold the phone at first after using OnePlus 8 for almost a year now. First, the lack of curved edges deprives you of a smooth navigation gestures especially with the cover on. Further, it is not the slimmest phone in this price catagory. But not so heavy.Full marks to the Super-AMOLED display, which is super cool and crisp. Even in broad sunlight, it is visible because of the 1,100 nits it offers. Build quality is very premium. Ergonomically well designed. Perfect for one-handed opraration. The front and rear is of corning gorilla glass 5 and the frame is metal (where as for the OnePlus 9 the frame and rear are of plastic!!) Lucky me! So it looks very elegant. But no IP rating for water proof is disappointing. But company says it is water proof. The insulation in the SIM tray is an evidence.The phone is superfast with a great sensitivity for touch and swipe gestures with the Snap Dragon 870 processor. 120 hz refresh rate is super smooth. Gamers would love it with a top-notch haptics (vibration features) and with the 244 hz touch sampling rate.Battery charging is very fast too. The juice holds up for quite long because of the better power management by the latest processor and the LLDR 5 RAM. Delightful!! Occassional warming yes during heavy games. That's normal. Camera is decent. Front camera is 16 MP should be a 32 in this price range. Avoid beautification option as you may look like a cartoon. Rear camera takes above average photos in day light. But below average during low light/ nights especially the wide angle camera. But it has optical image stabilisation even the OnePlus 9 doesn't have that. So shaky hand fellows don't worry for the blur. Videos are of best quality. Best in this category. With a good video editor and skill you can make cinema like videos but the stabilisation is not-so-good in the nights.Stereo speakers are of very good quality. It is loud and doesn't crack even at high volumes. Call quality is decent. Not comparable with iPhones though. And Dolby audio is very enjoyable with headphones. With a good quality earphones/ headsets, I assure it is not less than a immersive audio experience especially for games.'Flip to mute' and 'raise the phone to answer' features are missing. Don't know why. It is just a OnePlus 8T with a good looking rear camera console with Rs.3000 less. Even the cover of 8T suits perfectly on this.So overall I am satisfied if not delighted. My OnePlus 8 is still better I feel. But this is the best in this price range. Better than the vivo x60, Mi11X pro or even the samsung S20 FE especially for the build quality and the premium feel it gives. Also the oxygen OS is best out of all android OS'. Also the in-display finger print sensor and the face unlock, I have not experienced  anything faster, prompter and more acuurate in recent times with anyother gadgets!! But the phone has only one 5G band. Suggest not to use the cover supplied with the box. It gives a kinda smoky look and makes the phone look bulky. But withstands accident falls. I have ordered the sandstone bumper case from the OnePlus store. Lake blue colour variant is awesome. Best of all the colors of all the OnePlus phones till today in my opinion. Catches not much finger prints or smudges like the 8 series. Scratch proof. Phone comes with a pre-applied scratch gaurd sticker. So no extra purchase required. Charging cable is a bit shorter than OnePlus 8. Type C charger with 65W charging adapter. 0 to 100 in 50 minutes. One significant change here is the data transfer to and from computer is quite faster than my OnePlus 8 also using OTG. Adaptive brightness they have got it right this time. In previous Oneplus devices, it was irritating. I have become loyal to OnePlus because the life of OnePlus phones is quite long compared to any other leading brands. My OnePlus 3 still stands formidable after 5 years. One star less just for the absense of curved edges display and a not-so-slim thickness. Else this phone is very good. Though corner of my mind says the price should be 10% lesser.P. S.Not encountered any overheating or battery draining issues as highlighted by some users. May be because I bought the phone after the release of first software update  and updated before writing this review. If you are not a fan of flagship processors and not a gamer, go for the OPPO F19 Pro with half of this price. Slimmer, lighter and with 3.5 mm jack.

Poor camera for this price tag

Camera quality is very poor. Poorer than 1+ 8T.It seems need a software update for a better picture quality.Over all user experience between the range of below average to average as the premium feel is missing.As well there are many other bugs that need to be fixed, those bugs are very obvious.

People should've waited for the updates. Phone has improved alot and still recieving updates.  Battery lasts for 1 day, its subjective. Depends on usage.  Fast charging🔥Camera puts out great quality if you turn on High Resolution from top.No heating issue now, everything is sorted. But camera needs alot of improvement it's slow in clicking.But to be honest there's nothing you'll hate about the device, You are paying this much for the camera and the OS. For camera prefer the Pro bcs of OIS. OP9 has stabilisation mode but not that effective. Great phone, if not camera go for the 8TBattery update- Initially you won't see good battery life, bcs new device takes time to understand your usage pattern and then it optimises the phone. 1st day 10% dropped in 15 mins. But now 10% drops in almost 45-60 mins. Decent battery+ Crazy charger= Satisfactory 1 day usage.

Switched from One plus 5T.Slight overheating issue but that was the case with 5T as well. I am not a high end gamer but a general user, reading work emails, scrolling social media and playing card games.- The UI is amazing, very smooth as compared to 5T.- Camera is good at this range but not to be compared with phones which have camera as the sole USP.- Battery Backup is quite good with me staying on the phone all the time, it dropped from 100-30% in a day of full usage (and some board and card games)The options I compared before buying it:1. Samsung FE S20: Probably the only switch I could have done, but my experience with 5T helped me stay loyal to One plus.2. IQOO 7: Performance and feature wise, slightly better, lower price too. One plus suits social status and IQOO is a newer brand still building it's reportaire.3 iPhone 11: Old vs new dilemma, iPhone 12 was double the price. Switching after 3 years, I wanted a phone fresh in the market.4 MI XI: MI is for masses and I wouldn't buy a premium phone from this brand.

I'm shifting from OnePlus 6 so it's not a huge upgrade but neverthless, the phone is amazing. Fast, fluid display and excellent touch response rate. Very handy and lightweight which makes it easy to use while sleeping 😅😅.A little discomfert I face when I put it on charge that it heats a little more than I expected with 65W charging plus battery drain fast.overall it's a great product with a little downside things which can't be ignored.

Expect better from OnePlus phone
","
It doesn't match the quality that I have come to expect from OnePlus phones. I am graduating from OnePlus 6t. And definitely not expected based on the money you end up paying. There is nothing really special in the camera, atleast one doesn't notice a visible change except for the filters. The phone heats up like crazy even with simple operations like a video call (even after the latest Software update). Battery life is decent but not super sturdy as you would expect in a new phone, I can see this becoming a problem in the months to come.The good things are the performance, the gesture control, the ease offered by OnePlus switch.

Bought it for an 35K price its an incredible phone in this segment! Many said Oneplus 9 had a heating issues but surprisingly in my unit there is not heating issues at all!Pros:1. Excellent 120HZ Display for the day to day use, even under direct sunlight the display has enough  amount of brightness to read the content2.Primary camera SONY IMX 689 performs good in daylight,8K video recording with HDR is nice.3.Ultrawide camera SONY IMX766 captures excellent shots and also the videos.4.WARPCHARGE65W was good and I get the good battery backup with SOT of 6 hrs-6:30 hrs.5.Oxygen OS 11 was good for the day to day use! clean, simple and fast!6.Lightweight design- In-Hand feel is good and my favourite Alert-slider!Cons:1.Lack of OIS on the main camera does'nt performs well on Night shots but not in the case of videos.2.Oxygen OS 12 - No more older Oneplus is here, now its oppofied. better to stick with Oxygen OS 11 or  else a good Custom ROM.3.Only 2 5G bands is not at all a futuristic smartphone when 5G rolls out in India.4.Stereo seperation in speaker is not nice as compared to Oneplus 9R5.Fingerprint placement would have been slightly placed upper!

If you have a budget of 40000 this is one of the better phone to go for.1.Oxygen OS2.Good built quality3.Good performance4.Good screen5.Very fast charging6.Oneplus brandingThese being a few of the reasons.

Disappointment - 43 degrees of heat for 30 min drain m

I have been a OnePlus user since the original OnePlus. Never have been so much disappointed in a phone than this one.The first piece I bought - the battery heated up to 43 degrees and I couldn’t hold the phone. Got it replaced in the off chance that I had received a faulty piece.The second one - similar issues. Worse, the battery backup is pathetic. What use is a 30 min Warp charge if 80% of the battery drops down to 30% in half an hour of normal usage.Cons - Heating issues, pathetic battery life.Pros - None that justify such a price point.

I am writting this review after using it for two weeks. I was deciding b/w iphone 12 & oneplus 9 and ended up buying oneplus 9  5G. I regret my decision. This cellphone disappoints in two main areas, poor battery backup and over heating with basic usage. This happens even happens after optimizing few key features like 60hz refresh rate and switching off adaptive display, & other app background optimization. I owned oneplus 3t and that still gives better performance. I feel cheated!Adding plus side too, except heating and battery everything else is fabulous. Excellent camera, powerful processor, excellent touch screen, nearly stock android gives best android experience.

Do not buy from Amazon !!!

I have been a oneplus user from last 7 years and I can tell you that Oneplus 9 has major issues, that makes this phone an absolute no. It started overheating from day 1 but I gave it the benefit of doubt and after using it for a week I tried returning the product. The service engineer called me and convinced me to observe the phone for a couple of more days and if I am not convinced I will get a replacement/ refund.Even after that the heating issue still persisted so much so that I couldn't hold it. I tried returning it but Amazon has made it absolutely difficult to return mobile phones. They will deliver a faulty product and take you through multiple portals and checks if you want to return or replace the product. There is no way to get a direct replacement if you are not satisfied with the product.I am really disappointed in both oneplus and amazon. I would request you to not buy phones or any electronic product from amazon. If you really want to buy this phone then buy from a oneplus experience shop. at least you will have any option of replacement. Really shame on you amazon for crating such a harrowing customer experience.

Cheap low performance product with a royal price tag

1) I have purchased this phone just 3 weeks back from amazon so a brand new phone at 55k.2) Got the Oneplus 9 model with highest available memory and storage not to compromise on performance and quality with 12GB RAM, 256GB internal inbuilt storage.About my experience on performance & quality:1) The phone hangs most of the time during call and not even able to pickup or disconnect the call2) Hangs with background app activities.3) Camera quality is average like the standard comes at a 20k phone.Amazon and the seller knew the standard of the product so closed return window in 7 days instead of a standard 30 days policy for mobile phones to safeguard the sellerPrice to performance/ user experience is below average. The real Chinese manufacturer Oppo - the owner of the phone selling its Rs. 10k standard phones at Rs. 60-70k by influencing Indian customers. That's the power of marketing and distribution abilities.Amazon maintains the rating of these products with higher ratings (so taking screenshot of my review for social media post if Amazon discards this review).Stay away from their tactics from buying such cheap products.

Writing my opinion after using it for 15 days. Note I upgraded from oneplus 3 and till this date OP3 was working just fine so I had string reservation for oneplus devices.Pros:1. Really fast, you can play any cpu intensive games with 60+ fps.2. Wrap charge is mind blowing in 5 mins you can charge it for like 0-20% which is sufficient for a day for me. Also battery life is good for me I get around 1.5 days of battery.3. 120hz referesh rate make using this device a breeze.4. No heating issues.5. Wide angle camera is good.6. Decent build quality.7. One UI is really good.8. Camera hardware is good you get crisp images. But has a huge flaw which I will mention in cons.Cons:1. Plastic frame, not sure how this will affect its survival rate from drops and falls.2. Not so good camera, color processing is not good. Colors are all over the place. You cannot predict what you will get. Skin tones are not at all correct. And reds are too saturated sometimes. Whole ""Hasselblad"" thing is a big lie.3. It is not a triple camera system monochrome sensor is just useless.4. Poor haptics, vibration motor is not powerfulI bought this for its sheer performance and display and impressions that OP3 gave me after using it for 5 years. I hope OP9 delivers the same.

Poor poor camera

I don't understand the hype at all. It is fast ..fluid .. but the camera is just so horrendous.  Colours are over saturated. And I've tried to adjust display/ advanced display options thinking it may help with colour reproduction in the photos but nothing helps at all. Depth of field is fine but photos are more than just about depth. Especially under artificial lighting Skin tones appear washed out or reddish and my green mask looks grey.. maybe it can be improved with software updates. But as of now in the camera dept. It sucks so bad. Aside from the camera, the phone works well. Fingerprint reader in quick. And I get good battery life after adjusting a few things in settings  I've not experienced any heating even while charging or even while playing a few games or two during charge.

I gave the device for repair twice and still it's the same. Amazon's customer care is not interested in giving me any solution. When insisted on helping me with a solution on this, the executive threatened to disconnect my call and told me that they can't do anything about it. It's just a month old device and my 4th purchase from OnePlus. Highly disappointed with Amazon's customer service and after paying 40k I ended up with this trash.

Though the other reviews say a wonderful phone, I didn't see it so in the 2 weeks I've been using this.The worst part is OnePlus has limited 5G bands support. Only 2 bands, they thought it could be fixed with Software update but it's hardware issue. They can't fix that in this 9 series. I thought of returning it to get S20 FE but missed the return date by a day. I'll not keep this phone for much longer.Not a great battery backup. Less than 10hr on normal usage of calls and apps without wifi or any gaming. The OS actually takes up a lot of battery. The only positive point is 65W warp charger, charges phone in less than 45 mins.Camera is ok but not upto the mark for a 40K phone. 9R doesn't have the fancy camera setup. The selfies are better than the rear camera and even they are not good.Fingerprint reader lags sometimes. Doesn't read the finger unless I press it hard on the screen.It feels like a 6GB ram phone, not an 8GB one. Didn't see much difference from old iPhone 6S. Could do better in almost all aspects.

Apple made it a beast. From camera to gaming.. everything is top notch. The battery life is superb, best till now. Normal usage can go upto 3 days with full charge. Bought the earpods pro & iwatch to compliment this beast🤭

I have started using iPhone from 5 series and since then this is 7th iPhone which I upgrade and I must say till date this has got the best battery I have observed in any of my previous iPhones. Camera quality you can’t even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don’t need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it’s gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it.

I was very skeptical about the genuineness of the product that I would receive as it was not available in stock in stores. So, I brought all my gut feeling together and made this purchase. The product was delivered in time. When I opened the box, it was strikingly beautiful. I checked for its authenticity by verifying it from all different ways. Now, most importantly a genuine Apple iPhone 13 pro max phone was in my hand. It works great for me and has a longer battery life than the previous phones that I've had.

Writing after one week of usage. I switched from Samsung A50 (light and good quality. was very happy)All good and enough reviews are there online. Pro max is bulky. Hand will pain after holding for 10 mins for a call or browsing. Though many reviews told that, I overlooked the aspect.Think of it before buying. It is not a small thing. You won’t appreciate all others aspects of mobile when your hand starts paining.

Switched from Android to iPhone. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.

1st thing 1st... Look -- Very good looking phone and feel premium when you hold it.A refresh rate of 120Hz is good to feel on 13 pro max.

Battery life is also outstanding, with normal use a fully charged can go up to 2 days.  Very smooth and fast performance. Just go for it.

The phone is amazing if u have an iPhone 12 dont upgrade unless you want to experience 120hz wait for the next model. My first time using IOS took sometime to get used to but definitely worth it.

Great  Budget mobile phone

The phone is really great, I had purchased it in the first flash sale just looking the specifications & reviews from the Tech Bloggers.. Since i am also a food blogger i wanted a phone with a good camera ..Redmi Note 10 Pro Max is pretty good in terms of camera. there are various modes in which you can click pictures & can shoot for your Vlogging / Youtube videos. You can add a filter while you are shooting in that's something really great while one is shooting.The battery backup is pretty good as it can go up to 1 day i.e. even though if you shoot for 1 video.Attached few pics which can describe a bit of pic clarity.Charges in around 75-80 minsNow the most important point regarding the 5G connection.This phone doesn't have 5G, but just think once why do we need 5G thing in our phone when its not rolled out. by my guess, it would be rolled out by next year-end so it would be already 1.6 years by then. so why waste money in 5G connection by paying extra. Redmi has done a wonderful job by not installing in it & provide the phone at a reasonable cost.I hope it is useful for most.

Not a Paid reviewer - Decent Buy

Buying a phone these days have become a mammoth task, you spend hours & days in ""techy youtube videos"" & adding more to the pain is OPPO, VIVO & Realme ... (these guys launch a new phone almost every fortnightly).This is my first ""MI"" phone (Obviously the trust issue), Looking at the specs it seems to be a all rounder & yes purely it is.. It does the job in Camera, screen, connectivity & battery..I'm not a gamer, youtuber, tiktoker or anyone else for that matter, Just a regular guys who uses phone for,1) Calling - Which is good on this phone (no issue with any Indian network)2) Wifi support - does connect to wifi to browse internet3) Camera - Does take good pictures (for bigger events i use my DSLR)4) Display - Good for watching short time videos (for movies i use my TV or laptop)5) Battery - It does power up my 1n half day (i don't live on Mars so i have electricity at my place & not that busy that i can't charge my phone)6) Speakers - Yes loud enough to disturb other (Not a Sound expert can't define how may decibels the speaker makes)7) Processor - I don't know how thick it is (the nano meter) but it fits inside my phone & works fine.8) Headphone Jack - yes, it is available - you need to buy one separately not included in the box, as MI thought we already have headphones, like apple way.Overall, no matter how much you load your phone with feature either Hardware & software, this will not replace core devices which are meant for the sol purpose (like camera, sound systems, TV's, gaming console)Before buying anything these days don't go for online reviews, first understand what is your requirement & how long you will be using that thing.

Power button is faulty, need to press for more than 30 sec for switch it on. Wi-Fi connection  issue
","
The phone is awesome. Good camera and good display. But to use all these features we need to power on the phone, need to press continuously for 30 seconds then only the phone starts to boot.  Power button is faulty.  Amazon technical team has done their check and told to type a code and asked to check for key option in CIT, as that, was missing they initiated replacement.Got replaced phone, but calls gets cut automatically, no clarity of voice. Network reception is poor. Wi-Fi connection is too slow, but in my old mobile Wi-Fi connects fast, Wi-Fi capture is feeble. Contacted technical  team but they told already replaced one defective product, so irrespective of its defective or not they can't replace it and only refund is available.  Now typing this review using old mobile. Camera if you zoom and capture photos the objects look bit unclear, 108 doesn't shows it's quality, Cleaner app doesn't stops scanning, need to stop it forcefully as the option to clear obsolete files doesn't stop.Received  replacement for the phone bought on 1st April. But again power button is faulty... Don't know what to do... Also the brand box was having dirt on it. The customer service executive saw the photos and told its seems to used one.What ever app you opens the phone gets heated like iron box. Battery drains fast, but not at all fast in charging, only in discharging it's fast

Edited Review after 1 month of Usage!!! Disappointing Performance
","
Part 1 Review: Have been using Redmi Note 5 Pro since many years and have been a fan of Mi phones since them. The phone is now full and the only reason to switch to Redmi Note 10 pro max is because of Dual Sim+Dedicated Memory slot. Once again very impressed by Redmi Design. The phone is amazing. Slim and can be held in one hand comfortably. Notch doesn't create any disturbance for OCD people like me. Finger print sensor and face unlock is super fast. Silicone case provided with package is pretty good and phone looks amazing with supplied case, without hiding the color and premium look of the phone. Don't buy any other case. The available cases in market are not good and hides away the color and phone looks bad. Attached photos with supplied case and a flipkart bought black case for comparison. Speaker quality is slightly disappointing compared to my Redmi Note 5 Pro. But with this price, I don't expect the phone to be excellent in every aspect. The cameras are life like and are so clear and all your face blemishes will be visible so clearly 😜 Very good photo quality. 6GB memory is very good enough even for high end user. So go for 8GB if you don't care spending extra money. Otherwise it's not needed at all. The screen is AMOLED but doesn't really have a quality like Samsung. I don't care much as far as picture quality is good. I don't like Samsung phones. They become slow overtime and also battery 🔋 performance becomes bad. This is not the case with Redmi. It doesn't become slow on neither performance or battery. I have less than 1GB space on my Redmi Note 5 pro and it's still blazingly fast and battery is still like it is when i bought years ago!!!Part 2 Review after 1 month Usage:1. Touch screen sometimes is buggy and just resists to scroll across the screen. Have to restart the phone and it works again normally.2. Call quality is bad. Other party doesn't hear me properly many times. 5/6 out of 10 times. Even on whatsapp/Duo video calls.3. Speaker sound is inaudible for several apps and many videos on social media. The same videos are very loud on my Redmi Note 5 Pro.4. Screen quality is not even like a IPS LCD. My Redmi Note 5 Pro screen was much better.5. No option of selecting Night Mode in Camera.6. There are some strange spots all over faces when zoomed. Whosoever picture I take. So, actually it's high pixel camera is of no good for portraits.7. Pictures are bad when taken in low light.Overall, I would not suggest you guys not to buy this phone. Will update the review if phone works better after MIUI 12.5 release.

I'm writing this review after using this phone for 10 days.Camera - cheap, dumb and stupid. 108 MP camera?? C'mon, whom are we kidding. Pictures are super hazy and if you zoom it shows its reality. Just consider a camera to click regular pictures that's it and expect nothing.Display - Edited - 120 hz refresh rate is very bad inthis device. I ran hotstar and other OTT apps and watch movies and this creates hickups while in the video and I've to return to same 60hz.Processor - Very good as I have not used it for any heavy gaming. I'm a working professional and use phone only work talk and use office apps most of the time.Battery - It was clamiled to have fast charge but I find no big difference. Phone heats big time as you use it for nonstop.UI - Same as earlier no difference. I don't want my phone having unnecessary app preinstalled but MI you know it. They will give apps even if you won't want.I won't suggest this phone if someone is buying to get better camera. I'll suggest go with cheaper phone and get normal camera and concentrate on display, ram, processer. But if you can spend little more, go oneplus not MI.This was my 3rd and last phone from MI. I'm done with MI.Edited - I've place a replacement as its camera is creating problem also I have to restart it to work normally as many other fn start behaving weird example - color started showing heavily bluish.

The phone is really great, I had purchased it in the first flash sale just looking the specifications & reviews from the Tech Bloggers.. Since i am also a food blogger i wanted a phone with a good camera ..Redmi Note 10 Pro Max is pretty good in terms of camera. there are various modes in which you can click pictures & can shoot for your Vlogging / Youtube videos. You can add a filter while you are shooting in that's something really great while one is shooting.The battery backup is pretty good as it can go up to 1 day i.e. even though if you shoot for 1 video.Attached few pics which can describe a bit of pic clarity.Charges in around 75-80 minsNow the most important point regarding the 5G connection.This phone doesn't have 5G, but just think once why do we need 5G thing in our phone when its not rolled out. by my guess, it would be rolled out by next year-end so it would be already 1.6 years by then. so why waste money in 5G connection by paying extra. Redmi has done a wonderful job by not installing in it & provide the phone at a reasonable cost.I hope it is useful for most.

Not a Paid reviewer - Decent Buy

Buying a phone these days have become a mammoth task, you spend hours & days in ""techy youtube videos"" & adding more to the pain is OPPO, VIVO & Realme ... (these guys launch a new phone almost every fortnightly).This is my first ""MI"" phone (Obviously the trust issue), Looking at the specs it seems to be a all rounder & yes purely it is.. It does the job in Camera, screen, connectivity & battery..I'm not a gamer, youtuber, tiktoker or anyone else for that matter, Just a regular guys who uses phone for,1) Calling - Which is good on this phone (no issue with any Indian network)2) Wifi support - does connect to wifi to browse internet3) Camera - Does take good pictures (for bigger events i use my DSLR)4) Display - Good for watching short time videos (for movies i use my TV or laptop)5) Battery - It does power up my 1n half day (i don't live on Mars so i have electricity at my place & not that busy that i can't charge my phone)6) Speakers - Yes loud enough to disturb other (Not a Sound expert can't define how may decibels the speaker makes)7) Processor - I don't know how thick it is (the nano meter) but it fits inside my phone & works fine.8) Headphone Jack - yes, it is available - you need to buy one separately not included in the box, as MI thought we already have headphones, like apple way.Overall, no matter how much you load your phone with feature either Hardware & software, this will not replace core devices which are meant for the sol purpose (like camera, sound systems, TV's, gaming console)Before buying anything these days don't go for online reviews, first understand what is your requirement & how long you will be using that thing.

Power button is faulty, need to press for more than 30 sec for switch it on. Wi-Fi connection  issue
","
The phone is awesome. Good camera and good display. But to use all these features we need to power on the phone, need to press continuously for 30 seconds then only the phone starts to boot.  Power button is faulty.  Amazon technical team has done their check and told to type a code and asked to check for key option in CIT, as that, was missing they initiated replacement.Got replaced phone, but calls gets cut automatically, no clarity of voice. Network reception is poor. Wi-Fi connection is too slow, but in my old mobile Wi-Fi connects fast, Wi-Fi capture is feeble. Contacted technical  team but they told already replaced one defective product, so irrespective of its defective or not they can't replace it and only refund is available.  Now typing this review using old mobile. Camera if you zoom and capture photos the objects look bit unclear, 108 doesn't shows it's quality, Cleaner app doesn't stops scanning, need to stop it forcefully as the option to clear obsolete files doesn't stop.Received  replacement for the phone bought on 1st April.

Greetings !!! Design Okay, Camera Double Okay, but few things needs to be fixed...First of All, I'm a big fan of Xiaomi and proud of referring the same to my family and friends but recently, I got disappointed in purchasing Redmi Note 10 Pro Max.1. App Vault option button is there but not viewed nearby homepage.2. In Messages, we don't see Select All option to Delete All as found in other Mi mobiles amd grouping of messages like, Finance, Promotions, Notification feature is missing in this mobile update 12.0.63. Call Recordings facilities is there but no files been saved in the respective MIUI folder but showed as saved.  - Other Call Recording options like Auto Call Record buttons are also missing and when we try to record the call, each and every time the automatic helping voice is raised where it is accepted for the first time, but it hears always.4. Slightly, I face the heating issues then and there and expected the best of the Liquid Cool Technology as found in other devices in this price range.5.  Performance is not upto the mark in this high end Note 10 Pro Maxi like other devices in this range.6. With respect to Health apps Steps which is in-built not showing the exact count always. Especially while we watch and walk, the steps count seems idle but the count is calculated in the back-end and shows later.7. Call Notification in the top during the mid of the call while using multiple apps seems missing in Redmi Note 10 Pro Max where it is found in  other Mi devices we use to have a small Green color in top which indicates that call in progress.8. In Dialer Options when me manually type and call for the number it doesn't show two sim preferrence to choose like SIM 1 & SIM 2.9. In General, we are confused about this feature with Xiaomi whether to be happy or sad: Automatic Call blocking of the Spam or Fraud Person, because many times, we are receiving the important call from the Bank Relationship manager, Flipkart, Amazon Courier person number, etc some interview calls also seens to be Spam with Red highlighted and got blocked.  We are unable to unblock specifically and worst thing is we missed the calls plenty of times.10. Moreover, Network stability is not upto the mark in all Xiaomi and POCO devices as okay in Samsung, Realme and other few brands.  - Why because, we receive complaint from our office or friends that our number is not reachable where the same Service provider like Airtel, Vodafone is working fine with other phone brands in same location.So, finally the above mentioned are not complaints but it's our general request to share with you as a wellwisher and as Xiaomi product lover.Hoping that you will be fixing it all gradually and we wish you all success by reaching more heights in your growth.

After using few day i am writing this review for normal usage.1. First Dual App is not working lot of bugs  even given all permission. Ex. like Phonepe, WhatsApp's2. While receiving the phone call the UI is not showing properly.3. When opening dial pad the app is crashing.4. Some time touch screen is not working while moving around the screen.I was using Redmi Note 7 Pro for last few years. I do not face any issue on that phone all are prefect. After the new launch of Redmi Note 10 Pro Max its waste of money.Second Space: When we create a second space in this mobile performance is not good at all.System  apps updater: will always show red notification.Voice call is not properly hear while receiving or calling.New Sms message is not good at all it is not like old sms message.Fast charging percentage shows fake information it start from 75 and 95 it not reach 100.If they solve with a new update it will be good or it is not worth to buy this mobile.

Redmi Note 10 Pro Max has touch issue. I bought blue color 8GB it from amazon. After I received the mobile, it was working fine. But after 4 hours of use, i found a portion at the bottom portion of the screen not working. If I restart the mobile, then the problem gone. Again the same issue came after 4-5 hours. I informed Amazon customer care, they send expert to my place, he also found the same. Then Amazon send another mobile of same model, it has also same problem.

Over Heating | Call Recording Function very Bad | Slow Processing
","
Absolutely disappointed by Redmi (I was a user of redmi Note 7 Pro).  •Redmi Note 10 Pro Max becomes overheated in a couple of minutes and also it takes a lot of time to cool down. When it becomes overheated mobile data, Wi-Fi hotspot, GPS and camera will be restricted. If you are a traveller, it will be very difficult because GPS will be restricted.•They give many modes to record photo and video, but after recording in some modes, the processor is struggling to process the recorded data.•Call recording function in Redmi Note 10 Pro Max is really very bad.I am not able to record calls secretly. When we record the call, the call receiver can understand with voice that “This Call is now being Recorded”.*Redmi is going to lose their fan base and market share with this low quality products.

It's lighter than note 9. In terms of camera only the 108MP camera is worth it but if don't turn on 108MP the camera is not that great. Video recording 60Fps looks great but 4K 30fps is not good. But overall it's a good phone in this budeget segment.

The screen not getting off while I make a call, the screen is active during the call and while in contact with ear it makes many touchs and just because of that the call is being ended or muted🔇 or making unnecessary clicking sounds which make the caller to think that Im doing some thing Suspesious during the call. Sometimes when the phone is ringing the screen goes completely black and I'm unable to attend the call at right time. Because of these bad sonsors the main purpose of the mobile phone is becoming a big question mark?  And in pro max there is no such remarkable upgrades than note 10 pro just for 108 mp camera with not much camera futures we are suppose to pay Rs. 3000 more. Not that much satisfied with the phone after spending  Rs. 20000/- I don't know what to do right now😭😭😭

Screen flickering a lot....while on any app or playing games screen flickers ... You will not understand it untill you focus on it...I am scared some day the screen would not turned on and would have to change the display completely....Manufacturers should have to take this as an Major issue and provide the solution.The other hand Mobile keeps heating whether you are looking in the Whatsapp, Amazon or Myntra....I am just telling about these normal apps where no intensive work is needed for processor...still it reaches to 40℃Apart from this, if I start surfing on FB or Insta, the heating goes beyond 42℃...And when I launch a game WCC3 a simple cricket hame which is again not that much intensive like PubG or COD, this Redmi Note 10 Pro Max cross the 45℃ in just 10 minutes of game play...I already have got this pies replaced and the second one is also creating the same problem....Not sure why I spend money believing on Xiaomi, Redmi, MI phones.... Instead of Samsung

Look wise mobile looks ultra premium but the reason I choosed the max pro model is it's 108 pxl camera, but really it disappointed me as it looks like 16 pxl camera. It is not the money worthy at all. Please go with SAMSUNG as to take this I cancelled a samsung mobile so now realising I took a bad decision.

I am using hotspot for whole day so drains quickly.It is manageable, thanks to 33w charger.Display: 4/5Provided Super Amoled this time, multimedia experience is superb. Super Amoled helped in reducing weight. Screen appears slightly dull, Not as good as samsung.It can be put on 60hz and 120hz. On 120hz I felt lag while switching application.Performance: Yet to analyzeUpdate after 4 months usages: Played PUBG for 3hrs continuously in HD mode. No lag observed. Device hits a little which is again manageable.Value For Money: 3.5/5 You can consider other brands in this price rangeBest value of money product: Redmi Note 10 Pro 6/128Pros:Light weight when compared to Redmi Note 9 proDual Stereo speakers gives nice multimedia experience.Back panel looks premium. Feels good in hand.Cons:I felt network drops sometime. It was not happening in previous device. Update: Issue resolved.Auto call recording option is not there. Need to take help of 3rd party app.Minor bugs can be observed. Eg: WhatsApp notification showing incorrect sender name against message. Update: Issue resolvedPreloaded app give so much add. At last muted notification.I believe all the cons/issues can be resolved in the upcoming release.Note: Above review is after 2 days of use. I will update it after a week of usage.Edit: after 4 months of usages I have provided update on performance and Issue fixed.Thanks to amazon. I got my device on 3rd day of ordering the device.

Detailed review - 1st Hand Experience
","
I am glad I didn't get a faulty product as mentioned by few reviewers which made me bit skeptical while purchasing but I still went for it because Mi service is good in India being no.1 smartphone brand from market share perspective.Coming to review of phone, following important points which make me feel the purchase decision was perfect:1. Weight and thickness of phone: It feels light as well rugged when holding in hands, moreover the phone is quite thin which doesn't make us feel like holding a brick.2. Display: I would suggest to keep display at 120Hz itself because the phone (or maybe its software) is created in such a way that if you use it at 60 Hz, you are definitely going to see trails of texts when scrolling. Note that even at 120Hz the battery isn't fading fast. The sAMOLED display is really good. I got this phone for my mother who likes to watch videos on phone and she was pleasantly surprised when she watched videos in this phone. The LED screen really ups the video viewing experience (bundled with the stereo speaker about which I have detailed ahead).3. Sound: The stereo speaker console given in this phone is awesome. For those who don't know, stereo output is only possible if there are 2 speakers given and it helps in developing a surrounded sound effect (the one we get in theaters, TVs and with our music systems). The stereo speakers have enough decibel output because of which you can listen to sounds clearly. Phone ringing loudness is nice, you can easily hear your phone ringing in crowd if you keep the phone on highest volume and have a good ringtone.4. Build quality: Definitely looks and feels premium when holding in hand or when using it too. However, 1 thing which could have been a plus in this phone would be a gorilla glass protection at back and on camera panel as well. Currently, only screen has gorilla glass protection and not back panel, back panel is made of basic glass only which only gives good feel while holding and good looks when seeing. Even, MiA3 has it so it was not something which could not have been given in this phone.5. Performance: Ok, this is something which you can skip if you are a gamer and are looking for details of how laggy or non laggy the phone is while playing games. For day to day use, like watching videos, surfing FB, msging on WhatsApp and playing basic games like candy crush, Sudoku, etc. this phone doesn't give any lag (very obvious at the given specifications). I tried playing a racing game on this phone using the gyroscope sensor of phone and it was a good experience without any lag in the play.6. Battery life: Almost 2 days! Yes with normal usage and even using the phone as a hotspot, it is going over 1.5 days. Further charging from 1% to 100% takes less than an hour (when using the 33W charger which comes with phone). When the charging starts you can see the phone charging at rate of 0.05% per sec however as the charge approaches near 100% this drops to 0.01% per sec.Overall experience of this phone is good till now. Will update in case I face any major hiccups while using it in coming days.

Will break review in parts:1) Display: Amazing display with 120hz. If you are someone who watches content on mobile then just go for it.2) Sound: It has dual stereo speakers. Although the sound volume is little bit on the lower side. It's okayish.3) Camera: Camera is quite capable,  but processing seems bit off. The picture are highly oversharpened. Human subject appear too contrasty. Colors are accurate but hope software update fixes the above mentioned problems.4) Giving additional 3k then 10 pro worth it? No. At current camera quality I would say better save your 3k.Edit: After using camera for few days. Found workaround to lower over sharpening. Go to setting>image quality, and turn it into standard instead of high. It lowers over sharpening and still photos appear crisper but natural.

I have checked with permissions. Unable change messaging sim to other is a bit hard. Screen flickering more. Opening of apps taking more time  note 8 pro is better in speed. Anturu and all other bench marks aa shown in release is completely misguiding people.I have purchased note 6 pro, poco f1, k20 pro, note 8 pro, and this note 10 proax, of all al phones, this one is worst and not satisfied with the product as of now.Even though 108 mp camera,  not great pics, as I expected, only on paper the specs are increasing.May be miui bugs, but utterly disappointed. One you tube video has shown that it can easily be broken.Go for k20 pro, if you have budget or else wait for good sturdy mobile.

Touch Screen is not working. (Video Attached)

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 Touch Screen is not working, left and right side screen is working fine and very smooth, but few points are not even sensing the touch. In the center of the screen from Top to bottom, and one point is at center left are not working and very irritating to Use this phone like that  (kindly watch the Video attached). Very Disappointing. One more thing, it’s camera 108MP is not worth of extra INR 3000, you can go with 64MP variant also, but that variant wasn’t available, many a times I tried in Showrooms also. I think Redmi has played a smart move on it and haven’t manufactured that Variant. This is only to penetrate the market by showing a competitive pricing with low stock.Kindly Replace with the fresh and working piece.

Looks nice and premium but feels cheap plastic on hand. The 108MP camera is not upto the mark, even a 13MP Nokia camera is FAR better than this. Produces extra sharp and artificial images (but why?). The sound is nice and louder. The screen is nice but starts to give eye strain in continuous use of 2 hours at normal brightness. MIUI is okay, junk apps can be removed. There is heating issue. So my rating are,📷 Camera 4/10 (since marketed as camera phone)🔊 Sound 8/10 louder sound📱 Display 8/10 (though it generates eye strain 🤯 🤯 , the AMOLED is nice)✏️ Design 10/10 (feels like a flagship in first look)🔋Battery 5/10 (5000mah is not enough, it lasts hardly a day)🔌 Charging 6/10 (fast charging still takes 1 hour+ )⚡ Performance 5/10 (performance doesn't match the build and look, the Antutu Scores says it )Pros✅ Display looks nice with richer blacks and good brightness✅ Refresh Rate is nice✅ Design looks premium 😍😍✅ Sound is louder.Cons❌ Much heat build up in the display after an hour of normal use. 🤒🤒❌ Battery is not up to the mark 🤔❌ Charging speeds could be some faster❌ Camera could be better.❌ Camera could be much better.❌ Camera could be much much better.Still confused about the reliability of the display and overall system after seeing the stress tests.VerdictNot a keeper.

The phone literally is nothing more than a paper weight. So if u want a useless expensive paperweight buy this phone. Coz ths phone doesnt works at all.

I'm writing the review after using the phone 5-6 days usage which are under as follows -1. If you are camera/ photography lover just go for it.2.  In day/sunlight time if you clicking photo in 108 mp mode in ultra hdr mode it really superb.  Other mode are still not at benchmark even after update.3. Considering in future update, the same will be sort out.4. Display - screen is quite good if you compare with other super amoled display that not up to mark. But under 20k if you are looking this type of phone that good. You may proceed to buy.5. I know that 5020  mah battery is quite good enough for any phone to withstand the whole day. Here it seem that miui 12 is draining the battery more as compare to redmi note other phone. Normally my phone is giving 5-6 hours battery backup on my daily usage basis. That not good.6. Other performance - during call the phone speaker is superb I really love it. It's loud enough if I even not in speaker mode. That amazing👍👍👍7 .  In 60 refresh rate phone is little bit lag but in 120 fps it up to benchmark.  But if you set 120 hz refresh your battery will drain little bit more.8. Flagship look - yes it is... 😍😍 feel like premium phone.Not giving 5 star because it not a 5G phone.Overall  phone is good. Hoping battery issue will be solve out in future update.

Camera is good 108MP captures more details. Color calibration is not that much good very contrasting colors but i think it's best in market selfi camera is also good I liked it . Display quality is excellent Amoled 120hz is soo smooth .240hz touch sampling rate helps you to make your gaming experience more smoothy. Build quality is good front glass is gorilla Glass 5 but bevare that backside is not a gorilla Glass. but looks sooo premium in hand feel very slim and light weight and they managed to put 5000mah . Haptech feedback is avrg vibration motor is not that much good but it's ok. Stereo speakers is not that much loud that I expected but it's ok above avrge sound . Battery backup is good if you use 120hz it can last for a day . If you put  to 60hz it can last for more than one and half day. 33w charger is good it charges my phone 0-100 in 70-80min. Important thing is get app shit is there it shows some ads we can't uninstall some apps like Mipay etc.Over all excellent phone value for money. 8.5/10

Camera quality is pathetic. Picture quality is very bad. No option to capture a moving objects (sports mode). You cannot select at what mega pixel you want to capture a photo. Either at 108MP or a pathetic pre defined MP.  Its very difficult to increase brightness during taking pictures.Battery charging time is min 110 mins. When connected to charger it will show mi turbo charging for 5 sec like its actually charging fast. But in reality it has nothing to do with the actual charging. Normal usage will give you maximum one day battery life.There is no option for auto call recording. Although there is a manual recording button available during the call, but when you press it a voice is heard on both sides that "" this call is now recorded"". I mean what a lame feature. Redmi has seriously gone out of its mind in making this set.Due to new android policies one cannot find any app which can record calls automatically.Now I have to carry this phone for 1-2 years unwilling, as I cannot frequently buy new phones. Now I think that I Really should have bought any phone between 10-15K, it must have been better than this phone.And friends , seriously this phone is not some extraordinary phone. Its just a regular phone with high price.

Cherry on the cake was the 10,000 rupees loyalty bonus therefore I couldn't resist but upgrade.The phone feels premium although I miss the metal build on iqoo 3 but the hand feel makes up for it, it's not slippery like the last one.The display is gorgeous and bright.The speakers are slightly better than the iphone 8 plus and let me tell you this, I loved the 8 plus speakers.UI is responsive and switching between the apps is a breeze.Gaming is where I thought I would gain the most but I think the optimizations for the SD865 were so great that I barely feel the difference. Oh and the patch file makes BGMI run at 90fps ;) sweet!Cameras are great too, especially the front cam.Use Gcam for the rear camera to get better pictures.Battery life is decent too.Overall I am happy with the upgrade.-------------------------------Review after 3 weeks:There are definitely some software bugs, apps stop responding, touch issues, UI becomes laggy.I hope you are reading this IQOO, only strong hardware is a half baked cake, please optimize the softwares too.

 Intial impressions in 2 days use:Best phone in the 30K budget,1. Super bright and fluid Screen -It is whitish screen not like oneplus screens. On oneplus 7t observed little yellowish of screen compared to this iqoo 9 se phone, hence oneplus 7t screen looked over saturated colors and bit brighter in yourube videos2. Stereo sound - Nice - stereo seperation is fine for me, but not loud as oneplus 7T speakers3. Video Full hd+ support in almost all apps - you tube, prime, netflix4. Camera - front and back- super good detailed photos, Removed beutify default option and verified. Videos need to check5. Battery back up - For single chanrge it came up to 32 hours + still 8 hours battery available in moderate use. Screen on time is 5 hours 50 mins6. No heating issues at all inusage, observing little heat while charging the phone and this is common in almost all phones7. Fountotuch os 12 looking good, it came near to stock Android but still need to work on. Some bugs are there like while playing the youtube first time it is always showing play and pause option on videos, hence opened accessibiltiy settings and do some resets then only this options removed now it is fine8. Phone is balanced in weight, but you may feel bulky in longer usage.9 Power button is little bit high to reach, this is only for me, need to be careful in one hand usageMore advatages than cons, i suggest to go for this mobile. May update this review after a month usageThanks

I just got delivered the phone. After phone setup while using it as the daily driver (no gaming) the phone is heating up near the camera area. I have seen the reviews on YouTube, they also said this about the heating issue. It's quite strange to me despite having liquid cooling etc phone is heating on daily tasks operations. Kindly if someone at IQOO reading this kindly fix the issue. Else everything (hardware) is fab at such price point

This phone is clearly not fit for gaming. Call of Duty and Genshin Impact runs around 24 FPS regardless of the graphic settings. I feel cheated. Please ignore all the reviews on Youtube, they are not telling you the reality. I have a phone with Snapdragon 855 and that performs way better in the mentioned Games. Please don't buy this phone. Buy something else but not this one.

Minor heat but this device control well even this has a infamous Hot 888 chip

I just got this today nd. While  setuping phone became slightly warm.. can't say how it will perform while playing games ... I will update this review after testing..  Overall camera is good .. no lag .. battery backup is also good ... But I missed the headphone jack... Although type c to 3.5 (cheap quality) is given but there is difference......Updating my review after few days testing.. i found that this minor heating is normal ... Reaches 41 42 at Max nd normal usage it's at 35 36 .. The problem i faced is (i used miui before) themes r not free ... Close to stock experience UI well that's good 😊 nd the 2 major problem i faced is that I can't clone all apps like in miui (only social media apps) nd when I use funtouch os app locker.  The notification of those apps doesn't show .. it's just shows ""u have message"" doesn't show what inside or who send it..I hope they improve more in their UI

Pretty Powerful but above average software
","
Hardware is so powerful that the phone could be used for 4-5 years.Software is good but still needs optimisation. Funtouch OS doesn't seem as snappy as oxygen OS.The UI feels jittery during initial setup but seems to improve over time that's what I have experienced.The phone after putting cover feels bulkier.. but you'll get used to it after sometime. Ain't for one handed usage though.Cameras are decent, probably best under 35k. Both low light and day light pics are good. Don't expect cameras to be as good as that of iphone's or samsung flagship's. Won't be a problem for regular users who don't care much about the technicalities of photography.Display is very nice, 120Hz refresh rate offers better experience.Stereo speakers do the decent job as well. You can actually hear the stereo separation.The phone doesn't heatup while multi tasking and regular usage.  Didn't test the gaming performance as I don't play games on mobile.I bought the sunset Sierra color. But the space fusion variant looks much better and gorgeous.Verdict: If the brand name doesn't matter to you, If you are okay with Funtouch OS (Please try to experience Funtouch OS based phones in vivo showroom), If you are okay with slightly a hefty phone, Then you can go for it without a second thought.This phone is an all rounder under 35k and i believe that no other phone comes close to it's features or raw performance at it's price.

Just bad # NEVER SETTLE
","
After investing 34k one would expect that phone would be a good value for money.but in this case it's totally opposite.So let's just start withgaming: playing cod for 15 minute in low settings would heat it up like running gta V on a up laptop in medium graphics settings.bad gaming performance period.Software experience: in one word....sucks.full of bugs.for instance if phone is locked and someone calls me then both fingerprint logo and call button would go on top of one another.one more...if I'm playing cod and swipe down from the top then notification bar would appear which is fine( ideal flow) but even after tapping in the game, notification bar wouldn't disappear. 50% percent disappear rate.Again one more, sometimes 'close all apps button' wouldn't work.So how many stars: 0Camera: good photos but not very detailed onesMacro lens auto switch sucks.use it in non auto mode.cannot go too near to the object which is the whole point of macro shooting right.therefore, need some improvement in this department too.overall 3.75 out of 5.Display: 5 out of 5.no complaints.excellent quality.Network connectivity:excellent.Sound: excellent.One more 4d vibration totally gimmick.hit and miss.Totally disappointed with the software experience.Please do not buy this phone now.maybe few months later after one software update till then do not even think about it.Finally if ur hands are itching then based on my past experience,Would recommend to go for one plus in this price range.atleast they have better software with not very noticeable degradation in power.one plus has better haptics too.

Value for money phone if u know how to optimally use it
","
I bought the phone after some research and with launch offers and exchange bonus it was a great deal. The phone delivery was prompt. The phone is well built and has good overall feel about it. It looks premium however the brand value is still missing in the case of IQOO.1. Screen: good screen for the price, no issue encounter till now. Colours, touch, smoothness all as per the expectation.2. Processors: no complaints since it is 888 , however, the hearing issue is there but it is not a deal breaker. U can play high graphic games with ease.3. Camera: phone takes good pictures both from main camera as well as wide angle camera. For the price the camera system is competitive. 888 helps in post processing. Colours are sligly boosted and sharpness is good. Night mode is excellent for the price.  Selfy cam is good for the price. U will be satified with the overall camera package of the phone.4. Battery: battery life is SOT of 5 hours for heavy user. For moderate user it is 6 hours SOT. For someone who knows how to use the battery by using th phone optimally could strech it to 7 to 8 hours  SOT easily.5. Software: it is relatively clean and smooth and has decent amount of customisation. It is close to pure Android. However there is scope for improvement via update. MI UI and colour OS has more feature to offer. But u will have no complainte with OS as such. 2 years of future update and 3 yrs of security update is promised.6. Basic functions: call quality good, network reception is good , GPS works well and speaker are crisp and clear but are  only adequently lound.Overall.: It is value for money phone with powerful processing power, good screen and dependable camara setup and decent built. The battery is like flag ship phones. U will have to use it optimally if u want to have more out of it then a single day phone.

Google Chrome crash issues freeze when open it (after update)6 screen flickering issue in low brightness (on camera)IQOO 9se GAMING PROBLEM1. game space and ultra game mode - due to this feature many games graphics frame locked and setting capped in low performance(low fps problem)2. Atleast give real time game FPS metre3. Remove game frame interpolation its is gimmick not real work(due to this shit features frame not increases even default frame decreases in low frame who is @**hole says it's gaming phone)4. Not supported 300hz tsr and even 1000hz instant tsr in gaming mode please fix5.

 When i playing PUBG i have enabled 4d vibration but it was not working , sometime it give feedback like normal vibration..So in my device 4d vibration is actually not working, which was it selling hash tag.. i am very disappointed.Also normal vibration is very lowOtherwise PUBG experience was good and it well manage its heating during play.As per my experience, my previous smartphone was a Android one device XIAOMI A3 which was clean Android and regular and timely monthly securities updated in that device when i purchased this device with exchange of that A3 was updated to march security updates on 15th march... But this iqoo 9 se still today is29 march it doesn't get any update still run on February security updatesAs per my ITS UI experience i feel that software is not fully integrated with its hardware and it has Android 12 but features of Android 12 on stock Android is not available it fell like i am using Android 11.It has serious problem when i have to enable low battery mode while watching on YouTube then it pauses playing video and after that i have reopen the app again to play video on YouTube which is very annoying.It is not fully incorporated with Android 11 features like pop up or floating app over other apps , these features is very usefull in daily uses i feel disappointed as i campared to samsung UI core which gives much better experience then this as I'm using samsung tab A8 old model which is running on Android 11Apart from above it has good charging speed usually tool 45 minGood camera in daylight as well as in low lightGood display but with extra bluish tone then you to enable eye protection features available in notification panelsOverall good experience except software experience which is really very bad

Other than display and performance, Iqoo didn't really focus on anything else.Cameras are bit okayish.Vibration motor is so weak for a phone such budget and sound is not so good.There is no proper medium level of sound in speakers. Either it is too slow to hear or its too loud to bear

Best Value For Money

It's an Upgrade for me as I moved from OnePlus 3T to IQOO 9SEDisplay: 120hz refresh is much better than 60 Hz. Bigger screen better colors. Screen to body ratio is low and is pleasant to use a big screen.In Box: The mobile cover provided in Box is very good and does not hide the cool color of the Phone. The type C to 3.5 mm jack inclusion is one of the best thing I liked, switching from old phone is made easy with same Sony earphones. I use only a cover for my screen to avoid scrathes, it's provided on phone applied, one less hassle for me, thanks IQOO.Battery: Upgrade from 3500 mAH to 4500mAH feels good, though bigger screen and 120hz takes away a little. With 66W fast charge upgrade from 20W dash charge is a big change, come with bigger and heavier charger but the charging speed is so good, it's just a small break between big phone use sessions.Camera: A big upgrade too from 16 MP to 48MP and with OIS. Very nice images, liked the portrait mode with edge detection. Excellent in good lighting conditions. Need to start using ultrawide camera.. selfie camera has no change in MP size, but beauty mode being default on is bad. IQOO needs to disable beauty mode by default.Build: Feels strong, don't see a difference with one plus 3T. Feels heavy but usable.Gaming: Didn't buy the Phone for gaming, but tried my favourite game, Fortnite. Got 60 fps with low settings, but heats up a lot more then expected. 888 chip does its job, but heating and battery draining can't be avoided. It's still a compact phone and the graphics requirement is high, will stick to gaming on laptop.Storage: I don't know if it's LPDDR5 or UFS 3.1 which helps, but the document or photo reading speeds are much faster and feels light and smooth. App opening is also much smoother, it must be 888 in action. Not gonna use the extended 4GB virtual RAM. I feel it will be slower. Go for 12 GB version if you need more RAM.OS: Android 12 options are much advanced and provide lot more flexibility compared to Android 9. Funtouch OS is easy to use, doesn't look as clean as Oxygen OS, didn't face major blockers though. Liked ""always on"" display features.Verdict: @31K it's a good upgrade from One Plus 3T. Phone does feel premium and I personally feel better value for money from IQOO compared to OnePlus.

No call connectivity. Only missed calls
","
When you call other person, it does NOT connect once in every 3 times. When another person tries to call you, only ONCE OUT OF 10 TIMES it will be connected. Rest of the times you will see a missed call registered in their phone. I replaced the phone with a new piece and the same problem is repeated again. I changed all the settings I could, but no luck. When I place the same SIM cards in other phones, everything is working fine. So problem is with the phone itself.For JIO sim, it does not even show the option to enable VoLTE. Iqoo website says it's automatically enabled. But I doubt it. For Airtel sim, I could see the option VoLTE, I enabled it, but still I couldn't make calls.UPDATE:The replaced phone is also behaving in the same manner. For 10 days, I am using only WhatsApp, because calls are getting disconnected after 2mins. I suggest definitely not to buy this phone, although it's cheaper. Now, I am returning the phone.

Not up to my expectations... Pathetic OS optimisation

In war, a blunt sword of gold (Snapdragon 888) is useless compared to sharp sword steel (Snapdragon 712).I bought iqoo 9 se in exchange of vivo z1x. Although vizo z1x was mid range phone...it was the best phone I have used with respect to performance and optimisation...I have used OnePlus 5 and motorola x style in the past..Coming to iqoo 9 se...1. the software is worst... although I like funtouch os in vivo z1x... Many of the options in settings are not available in iqoo 9 se... like files explorer,  file locker etc..2.setting app is not well managed..specially permissions section...it was better in previous version of funtouch os.3. Settings app is crashing when I click 'Ram & storage space' setting.4. Even small games like 'cricket league' is working with frame drops...even in ultra game mode.5. No call recording option available6. Due to poor optimisation, battery performance is below average.7. Heating issue observed in normal ussage (without gaming)...again due to poor optimisation.Hoping iqoo will soon come up with updates to optimise the OS.

Best ever value for money phone
","
I got this phone for 20k as i exchanged my old phone(realme 7 pro) plus a bank discount of 3k which is a killer deal.I have been using this phone for the last 3 days and played bgmi on it for more than 6 hours(no fps drop at all).Its a beast to start with.Also camera on it is peaks dont get fooled by 48mp its just a number the OIS system makes it look like dslr image shots. Just go for it.

Great phone for the price...

firstly I upgraded my phones after 6 years  so I felt huge differences.1. display is great anything below 1080p looks bad on the display. You are so used to that detail.2. Form factor is good matte glass looks and feels premium but use case anyway.3. Performance is good,  888 it is so expected.4. Camera is the biggest upgrade for me, captures good detail, night mode is impressive, not flagship level but Still great for the price i bought.cons:optical reader is bit slowno option to charge at lower wattage.battery menu doesn't have a lot of options in whole.Backup is adequate.

Note: Careful don't uninstall useful apps dude.Speakers are good but not that much high soundIt have Default 4 GB RAM Extension as true.. (Many other brands gives atleast 5-9GB Extension)Good RAM Management But worst part is few apps default is getting back to Official default for me.Light weight and slim design.Purchased 12 GB variant @35,000₹ with bank officer.

Really flagship killer

I use this device since last 15 days, i also have i iqoo 7 and mi 11x. Obviously 9se far than these devices what i have,Display make me fall in love with itiQOO 9 SE focuses on offering some top-notch tech under the hood that especially helps gamers make most of the high refresh rate support. The phone has a 120Hz AMOLED display with a dedicated Intelligent Display Chip. The chip, using the frame rate interpolation technique, increases the frame rate of support games. Currently, BGMI supports frame rate interpolation up to 90fps on the iQOO 9 SE. More on the gaming bit in the performance sectionDDR5 ram and ufs 3.1 storage its realy halp  day to day task.Considering OS I'm not wonder,I'm believing that company push Origin OS update soon, i hope

IQOO, what is that? Don't know much about this company till I own it's phone. What I expected from my new phone is a big battery and lower the charging time (fast charge), reasonable camera, longer phone life period (not to be outdated in a year).Decided to go with SD 870/ 888 processor to have some updated support for 2-3 years.Compared few mobiles with similar specs and zeroed to IQOO 9SE, for it's hardware and price tag, felt compromised on battery. Phone delevered with battery at 40% charged, tried charging and that scared me as it took longer than expected. Add to that, during phone setup and transfer old phone to new drained lots of power. But that improved a lot in two days, charging real fast now, and discharge rate is in control with normal usage. Can say whole day battery as of now.Unlocking the phone is excellent, Finger print sensor and face unlock both are ultra fast and smooth. Can unlock in low lights, nights with face unlock. That is amazing.Camera, satisfied with it's performance as not expected much.Tested Antutu score, amazing 831425, slightly greater than site list, and placed at 12th rank as on date.Final impression,Value for money.

Its really stable and smooth, something that really got me when i started using the phone is the poor haptics and low - speaker volume.Cameras and video are excellent.Software is kinda a basic and straight-forward, there is not much advanced settings that one can change or disable.Haven't played any games on it, but will update when i do.Display is not amoled grade colour but still very good, great outdoors visibility and smoothness.( Remove stock screen protector and apply tempered glass for best experience).Its a bit heavy and big compared to my older s7edge, so needs a bit of time to adjust.The frame is plastic so do take care, hard scrubs or pocket dirt can scratch it, if not used with care, mine got top-side shallow scratches in a week.Overall recommended, for smooth hasslefree experience.

True Review

1. Heating: Phone heats up. Even while downloading apps from play store, phone was heating. While charging also. As of now heating issue is there even after installing the latest upgrade.2. Chrome is not crashing for me.3. Green tint issue is there. When u reduce the brightness in dark surrounding, u can easily see it.4. Charging is good but only when phone is idle or off. For me, charging is taking more time than claimed by IQOO.5. I liked the camera.6. Some times I felt that touch was not very responsive.Conclusion: i think one should go for other brands which has stable UI and less heating issues. Though I got it for 21k with exchange, still i think phone should have performed better.

Pros.1. The Display is amazing.2. Camera is chumma. The colour processing of this phone is amazing.3. Build quality very Good.4. Comes with Android 12 out of the box.5. Bluetooth connectivity is fabulous6. Network connection for voice calls are very strong.7. Some people complaint abt funtouch os being mediocre or rate it below other os like oxygen OS. But I feel funtouch is very good. Need to try it to understand it.8. Weight and feel of the handset is too good9. Batter gets charged in approx 35-40 mins which is amazing.Cons.1. Battery 🔋. This phone is a hungry phone and let me tell you it has a very big appetite when it come to battery. But again it's been hardly a week since I purchased this handset so I believe the battery is still not optimised yet or showing its full potential yet2. Some sensors like shake for flashlight is not that good. I was using moto before compared to moto then sensor for flashlight is below average.3. At times when I try to do conference call the screen just blanks out evn ef there is nothing near the sensor. It's kinda irritating. I believe it can be solved via software update.4. The phone heats up. But cools down also fast.I believe that's it. If I come accross anything else I'll update it.The phone all in all is Chumma😘

Think twice before you buy

I am a fan of MIUI, the UI was well optimized in recent times. I was using MI10i which was a decent phone with good performance. For an upgrade I just moved to IQoo 9SE.PROS:There is no compromise on the performance.Camera is good.Display does its job really neat.CONS:Has tons of bugs.When compared to MIUI 12.5 , Funtouch OS 12 is nothing. Not enough features and rubbish contents.Battery performance is not optimised.Found some heating issues in normal use.BUGs you may notice:1) Settings app will crash when you navigate to settings--> Ram & Storage space.2)When the phone is locked and you are receiving a call, the fingerprint logo will overlap the call button.To Funtouch OS developers:We don't need a Oxygen OS level UI, atleast try to match with MIUI.If you can do that, pls release mobiles with Stock Android OS.

Don't but. Please listen to me don't buy. After consulting many other iqoo user i have noted down following issues.1. Screen is flickering.

Screen turing black or screen freezing issue.5. Video and audio lag.I am facing problem number 4 and 5. Once While using chrome screen froze and another time while using Netflix. I had to hard press power button to make it work. Once there was audio and video lag in YouTube. It's entirely new problem which i haven't seen in any smartphone till date but it's there in iqoo 9 se.I wasted my 30k money on a garbage product.Ya if iqoo fix these problem then it's one of the best phone out there and can give competition to 45k phones.

I Got the Phone at 22,700 after exchangeing almost a non working phone.

(As i was using it before)You cannot keep the 120hz setting for 24 x 7The phone heats a lot like a lot.I would recommend to remove pre applied screen guard and replace with it a glass guard

Posting This After 8 Days of Continous Usage:I came from Oneplus 5t that too because last to last week I had an accident and my 5t has dead on the spot.After watching a lot of reviews on Youtube and Amazon, I thought I should give it a chance.First Impression:-• As you all know OP 5t has small display so it's hard for first 3-4 days to use/Typing because of big display.• A little heavy but that could be because of upgraded species and battery from my last 5t.• Solid built but it if it's metal build then it will be more beautiful.• Space fusion color is looking killer.• Flash charger works awsome but charger design can be improved• Display is crisp and clear but but in dark apps (i.e, chrome, brave, linkdin etc) you'll notice a color change (from Black to Greyish color) that gives a cheap feel and I don't know if it's a software or hardware issue.Actual Review:-• While gaming (Call of duty:mobile) has some lags and bugs and there is no option to block notification/calls even after mute notification ONN everything is coming on screen and it's very frustrating and annoying.• Battlefield mobile ground, Asphalt 9, Clash of Clans, Battle Royale are working flowless.• Some apps like Flipkart and Airtel gives some error (screen zoom automatically while opening) might be because of android 12 or something else.• Now this is very weird that this phone reset a few setting automatically themselves when I don't want that. I don't want to set them everyday before using my phone (i.e, I am using Bouncer to remove app permission when not in use and this phone remove accessibility setting even after batter optimization and background run.While listing to music I want paranomic 360 sound but it reset to default automatically.• Gesture are not working fine, this can be fixed with future updates.• I admit that funtouch OS has some more customization then Oxygen OS but it is missing some basic customization feature like I cannot change accent color, shape, size and the default one is looking very cheap must be because Oneplus oxygen OS is in my eyes but I am not overcome from oxygen OS, Oxygen Os is lub• Funtouch OS is very uncomfortable for me for the first 4-5 days but now I'm getting it a little.• Less feature in gaming mode in comparison to Iqoo 7📷Camera:-• Average as of now takes good picture in night/evening time and selfie camera is awsome.• OIS works good as per the budget and gives value for money.• Day time picture are good but something it changes the saturation/color by itself automatically.• No heat observed while gaming/doing heavy task (minimal heat that every phone has now a days and it is 40°c outside so this is not a big deal for me.• Screen recorder and mic works awsome• Crisp clear display except the issue I told above• 6-7 SOT in one charge (0-100)• 42-44 minutes charging time (0-100)• No bugs lags observed till date• 120Hz refresh rate made it monster• Some preinstalled bloatware can be uninstall but some has to be force stop only or you can use Adb commande to remove permanently.• A few apps are unnecessary like browser and a screen (virus scan) comes just after install an app from play store that very annoying and somehow I stopped that.• Speaker volume is sufficient (enoug loud in a room)Conclusion:-In 31k it's worth for money with Snapdragon 888 processor and intelligent chip.Only thing that I don't like is funtoch os because it not gives a premium flagship phone experince.Has some bugs as of now (i.e, In gaming mode, in a few apps, camera, Display) that might fixed with future updates.Overall worth for money, And Yes you can pick it over Oneplus 9RT (like I said you'll probably feel bad for a week with it's Funtoch Os but you'll be okay with it after sometime.Just because of oxygen os spending 8-10k is not a great idea I think.

Better than my expectations

Phone is worth the price. Faced heating issue only during initial setup , which made me worried but after that did not face any heating issue in day to day tasks. Uninstalled all the blotwares and disabled hot apps(takes 5-10 mins) after that did not face any ad in my 3 days of usage, no shitty in-app ads like miui and no shitty notification ads also except default browser current affair news notification like chrome. Camera is good for the price, but if camera is facing sunlight it blows out the background and only focuses on face, this only happens if there is human face in the frame, I think the camera UI gives more priority to human face. Charging is blazzing fast however the battery back up could have been better, its still good. I did not expect the Funtouch OS to be this much smooth. Button placements are also good , easy to reach with one hand without any stretch. One think to consider before buying this phone is not every feature present in miui is present in this phone, like cloning is limited to certain apps and settings menu is little bit confusing , may be because I'm using Funtouch OS for the first time. Only reason why I'm giving this 4 stars is because I faced Chrome issue one time where it got stucked in Chrome logo, even clearing data and restarting phone did not help and I had to wait for Chrome to crash.Update1- decreasing one star because of camera. Night mode is automatic in this phone. Even if I want to click normal night photo ,camera AI clicks photo in night mode even when AI is disabled. So you cannot click night photo from this phone as it turns everything into day using AI night mode, which should not happen if AI is turned off.

ALL-ROUND PERFORMER

I am using IQOO9 SE since last 10 days. On the basis of it, I am sharing bellow observations:Pros:1. Excellent display and build quality: Though it has plastic body, it feels very solid in hand. It's back feels like matte glass finish, but it is plastic. I am  Space Fusion matte black version and it feels really grippy and solid in hand. But it doesn't really matters as I used it everytime with plastic cover provided with it.2. Solid performance: Snapdragon 888 flagship processor from last year is very solid stable performance while gaming and everyday task. It is stable than 8gen 1 and with no heting issue or performance degradation after 2 hours of gaming. It is warmer but not much.3. Flagship grade Camera: It don't have gimble stabilization like IQOO9 and iqoo9 pro. But it comes with OIS which works excellently to provide stable shots. It excel in dynamic range and color science. Images clicked have true to life colors. Ultra wide angle camera also provide decent images.No complaints regarding selfies, as they are very eye pleasing. Low light performance is also very good for the price. 1080p video recording is also class leading. It also provide gr8 video at night with very less noise.4. Decent Battery Life: I am daily using my phone for basic task like web-browsing, social media and YouTube video. And taking 10-20 pics daily and record 1 video everyday. For this use I got around 7 and half to 8 hours of SOT , which is decent for Snapdragon 888 with 4500 mah battery. While gaming phone drain faster and get around 5hr of SOT with around 2-3 hrs of gaming.Cons:1. Average UI and Launcher:  My only complaint regarding this phone is its UI. FUNTOUCH OS is not as polished as OneUI or OLD OXYGEN OS 11. Many design decisions are questionable. In the system launcher integration of app  drawer and Widget tab in same panel is not very intuitive and polished. Also the A-Z scrollbar in App drawer is loking very bad and useless. Launcher needs some more customisation option like increasing size of app icon more than 100 % and support for external icon pack.

Fingerprint sensor issue during calls . If we want to open the device while call using fingerprint the call also getting disconnected . I contacted customer service of Vivo they said beacsue of this device every one having this issue .Pros:1.Best value for money in the segment of snapdragon 8882.10 5 G band & NFC supportCons:*Heating issues and battery 🔋 drains fast*Some minor issues with the o.s*Camera 📸 performance was average*Amoled display was not so bright when compared to other DevicesLeaving these this was really a monster 💀

Best SD 888 Phone under 35k

Fast and smooth delivery experience by Amazon. Coming to the device, I'm truly impressed by it having used it for over 10 days nowPros:1. Fast and smooth UI (8/10)2. Camera - In daylight - Front (9/10), Rear (9/10)3. Battery - Easily lasts a whole day with regular usuage and charges fully from 0-100% in 40 minutes4. Display - 120Hz smooth adaptive amoled screen - 9/105. Speakers - Great stereo speakers (9/10)6. Thermals - Did not overheat over prolonged usage although it could get a bit warm with demanding games like GI or BGMI, or while charging which is to be expected. (8/10)Cons:1. Haptic feedback could've been better, especially while typing. The motor doesn't have that bite to it.2. Camera - OIS is not too practical. You still need to have stable hands to shoot a video although it will slightly aid with the stabilization. Low light photography could've been a lot better as well.2. Had a few bloatware but most of them are removable so that's a good turnaround.3. By default, you may find the display to have a warm tone to it but you can adjust it manually to your liking.4. Size of the phone will not allow single handed usage, it is slightly bigger compared to Iqoo 9.

Snapdragon 888 heats alot but overall very smooth performance

It is a good midrange and a beast for gamers . But it's get heat as I purchased this in May in the hot summer season. Overall the performance is very good. Camera, display, battery(should be 5000), processor and other factors are really well. LPDDR5 RAM & UFS 3.1 storage is worth for this one... I got this around 24.5k with exchange and coupon...you can surely get this one of you are getting good deals around 30k...no other brand can come around this if your perspective is performace and overall.

I have started using iPhone from 5 series and since then this is 7th iPhone which I upgrade and I must say till date this has got the best battery I have observed in any of my previous iPhones. Camera quality you can’t even think of comparing it with any other phone in the world. You definitely don’t need to carry a FSLR or a video cam after you own this piece. You can literally make a professional movie from its camera.The only thing is that you need to shell out hell lot of money to be the owner of this beauty but at the end it’s gives you the satisfaction nothing else can give you because you own the best.My suggestion is go for it only if you have the capacity to own it.

Now, most importantly a genuine Apple iPhone 13 pro max phone was in my hand. It works great for me and has a longer battery life than the previous phones that I've had.

Switched from Android to iPhone. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1) The battery life on the Pro Max is just excellent. No android with even a 6000 Mah can beat it, it is that well optimised.2) The camera as you can guess is one of the best if not the best.3) The screen with 120hz feels so smooth. It’s just a different experience. Androids with similar refresh don’t feel so smooth because they are poorly optimised.Cons:1) The price. Got the 512GB pro max for 1.55 lac. and that is not at all value for the amount of money you spend. With no charger!2) Software wise, the notifications are really bad. Android compiles notifications much better. Also, it’s really tricky to transfer Whatsapp and other stuff from an Android.

This is not really worth 1.3 lakhs ! Nothing is so great which asks for this price !! Same old notch, outdated design , no charger , even all these charger ,phone cover and screen guard costs another 5k ! Only buy if you really need it and it was your dream to have , people giving here 5 stars are those who dreamt of having Apple brand tag ,they are not really buying for any ground breaking technology !! Any phone around 60k-50k can do all the stuff this phone can do and more, if going for Chinese brands ,then even at 30-40k you will get very good phones which has better or same display battery backup almost same good camera  !!

The product is much sub-standard for the price. Build quality is extremely bad. Heating issue and call drops whenever long duration call. Requested return the very same day purchased but was told return not possible. After 2 days refund option became highlighted in app. Raised a refund request and called the customer care to find the refund amount. Got mail from Amazon confirming the refund amount based on which agreeed to return the product. Refund processed was INR 5000 less. On calling escalation, was told that it was a false promise. Because of Amazon written false promise, I should loose my money. Never again going to buy any high value product from Amazon.

Buying an Android flagship phone isn’t easy and requires lot of research. So sharing my experience- why I chose this, and what I like-1. 120 Watt charging – hmm.. is it important ? .. well its good to have…but in reality it feels like magic. the charge percentage moves up in real time so fast! Now I need not put my phone for charging evry night. Even when stepping out, if there’s low battery – need to just charge for 10 mins, and am ready for full day outing.2) Best Photo quality is #1 priority for me. I take a lot of photos of my family, kids. The 108 MP camera does justice to this. The photo qualities are top notch. The selfies also come out really great. Best way to distinguish a great camera from a good camera is to review low light/ night time photos. With Xiaomi 11T pro – night shots are brilliant, without photos getting grainy. Bloggers have talked about special modes such as vlog… yet to try out (am a little old for this!)3) Nowadays Display are getting a lot of attention – and that’s a good thing. This phone has all possible certifications/ jargons to be called out as best display. dolby vision..120 hz display etc. Just lets you know that don’t worry – you have the best display.4) Sound quality of most android phones is poor… especially when you put the phone on speaker. Tried this with 20-30k devices in the past. This has harman kardon speakers and some fancy certifications which aren’t easy to get I assume.After using I can clearly say the sound quality, speaker volume is almost twice as good as any other phone I have tried.5) And this has been just wow.. It is the absolute best multimedia experience that I have come across on any device till now.All other things that you expect in a 40k device have been taken care of – 5G, great processor, fast and responsive OS. There’s nothing missing.Overall – If you are looking for a Android flagship – you must go for this device. The price is really sweet when compared to alternatives.

Amazing Device, Really Liking it.

I bought this phone more than a week back and after using it for a few days, I can say, I’m totally satisfied with my purchase. Compared to the last Xiaomi device I had owned, I can say xiaomi has come quite a long way in terms of improving the devices and this one is a totally amazing flagship device.The charging on this one is blazing fast. I was skeptical of the 17 mins claim but after purchasing, I’m getting 18-20 mins full charge time and that is better than anything else available in the market right now.The 108mp primary  camera is just amazing, it gets such nice pictures. The night time pictures are also very goodIt comes with harman kardon speakers, which is great because you get stereo effect, and the audio quality is just so superiorThere is dual 5g sim slot which supports upto 13 5G bands, so yes, this is going to be a solid future-proof device when it comes to connectivityYou can also record video in HDR10+, which I think is not possible in the majority of smartphones available out there in the market.

I have been meaning to upgrade my phone from my last Poco F1 for some time now. I had browsed through a lot of devices before buying this one. I had 9RT and11T Pro as my two final choices but I picked Xiaomi 11T Pro since I felt that it is a much better product offering and that too at a much better pricing. I am very satisfied with my purchase so far. Sharing below some of my most preferred features:1. Display - It has a 120 Hz- true 10-bit AMOLED display. The display is super bright and has vivid and punchy colors.This is truly a flagship grade display coming from the house of Xiaomi. It even has HDR 10+ and dolby vision support. Really enjoyed watching content and playing games on this phone.2. Sound - Quite frankly, one of the best audio setups I have seen on any smartphone in a long time. The audio front comes packed with features- dual symmetrical speakers tuned by the legendary Harman Kardon, support for dolby atmos and Hi-Res audio, you can actually experience a spectacular audio quality with this audio setup. It is really loud and clear, bass and clarity of the audio system is amazing and doesn’t leave anything else to be desired.3. Charging - I was excited to test the fast charging myself and I can tell you it really charges from 0 to 100% in less than 20 mins. Really impressed with the Hypercharge. And the phone comes with a 120 W charger included in the box itself which is amazing.4. Camera - I have been able to click some pictures from the 108 MP triple camera on this phone and I must say that I am impressed. I love the tele-macro camera. The camera shots are super detailed. Night mode performance on this device is also amazing.The page mentioned that it uses something known as ‘dual native iso’ which I don’t actually understand but seeing how it takes such amazing pictures in low light environments, I guess it must be working well.5. Processor - snapdragon 888 SoC provides a smooth experience. I haven’t observed any lags so far in my usage. Also played NFS and Asphalt 9 on the phone, experience has been good.6. The MIUI has also improved a lot and now you can also uninstall system apps and there are no ads like earlier. The overall software experience is much cleaner and smoother.100% recommend this phone to people looking for a new flagship level smartphone.

Camera is very slow. Slight moving object get bluir picture shot. Screen rotate sensor is hard and not move screen easily. Camera is very average. Motion picture gets Blair.So called 120w charging is gimic. As fast it get full charged it drains power quickly. Battery back up is poor. The phone is Not value for money. No external storage and 3.5mm audio jack. Highly priced average phone. Better to buy lower version iPhone to buy with 43k budget. Think and compare before buying this phone. Only marketing gimik of Coming mi. I regret to buy this phone

 The best thing about this phone, I will repeat this a hundred times, is the speaker. WOW! Just magnificent sound clarity and equally balanced. It feels like it's coming from a stereo. This phone with its 10bit HDR display and mind blowing speaker is awesome for watching high quality movies.The camera is so much better than most Xiaomi devices. The macro camera just blew my mind. 🤯 Don't forget to try out the Clone mode and many different cinematic modes MIUI offers.Performance is very smooth but the SD 888's heating issue is very real.Super Wallpaper looks really cool.The bad reviews about battery draining is either defective pieces or it will definitely be resolved in upcoming updates.. I don't face any issue with draining. Realistically it charges to 100% in around 30-40 mins. It can be a lot more faster when switched off, but I don't recommend it as it really heats up the phone.The phone feels really classy.. The best variant is Moonlight White, in my opinion.This is my first flagship phone and I'm absolutely impressed.

The macro camera just blew my mind. 🤯 Don't forget to try out the Clone mode and many different cinematic modes MIUI offers.Performance is very smooth but the SD 888's heating issue is very real.Super Wallpaper looks really cool.The bad reviews about battery draining is either defective pieces or it will definitely be resolved in upcoming updates.. I don't face any issue with draining. Realistically it charges to 100% in around 30-40 mins. It can be a lot more faster when switched off, but I don't recommend it as it really heats up the phone.The phone feels really classy.. The best variant is Moonlight White, in my opinion.This is my first flagship phone and I'm absolutely impressed.

Worst battery, worst camera, fake promises
","
Worst mobile with fake promises.. Battery charge specified as 17 mins but in realtime it takes 37 mins which is twice the prescribed time... Battery drainage is very high, even for 10hrs standby battery consuming nealy 8 to 12 percent... Front camera is worst, only super macro cfeature was working upto expectations. I took replacement for the first mobile, then I received very another defective product where the display has vertical white shaded lines which is very much disturbing my focus.. Xiaomi has produced a very worst product with a very great efforts.. All specifications are completely fake compared to realtime handset

Beast in the spec, heavy in hand
","
Brought it as this was the best value for money I paid. Got the 12/256 variant for 34K after exchange discount and card discount, so was a good deal for the specs offered.Amazon created a mess out of delivery experience though. Amazon earlier had Open-box delivery wherein we could verify the contents of the delivery box by opening it in the presence of delivery person. Now that is not available anymore, at least not for mobiles, as now they have replaced it with something they call ""Tamper evident packaging"", where they ask the customer to check color of a packing strip and if it has turned pink, asks customers not to accept the package. Seriously, Amazon ? What if someone is color blind? The delivery boy refused to let me open the package, so I sent him back. When I called up Amazon customer care, all they did was to tell me delivery boy should have allowed me to open the package, and the one coming next day would do so! The cust care exec did not know about tamper evident packaging! Even delivery boy did not know that there is no open box delivery, instead there is this stupid tamper evident packaging.Next day another delivery exec came, but this time he created big mess of exchange process. He wanted a brand new mobile for exchange! He was expecting my 5 yr old used OnePlus 3 to be as good as new, and initially refused to accept exchange because there was a hairline scratch (mind you, not crack, it was a scratch) on the metal body! After much persuasion and guarantee that if his boss did not accept the used mobile for exchange I shall pay him the difference amount, he accepted the mobile reluctantly. That was a terrible experience, because if the second delivery attempt also had failed, I could have lost on the deal. So this time, I took a leap of faith and accepted the package even without looking at package strip color code.Coming to mobile, its a beast for the price paid looking at the spec. Charges very quick, about half an hour for full charge. Dual speakers are nice, but not loud enough. Display is beautiful. Pics in the camera looked more artificial and over-processed compared to what the camera in my OP3 delivered. I come from OnePlus background, so may be I need to learn to use this camera.Phone is tad bit on heavier side, so its definitely not comfortable for holding in one hand for extended period of time. Charger is easily around half a kg.

New Beast in Town!
","
I purchased this phone last week and the experience has been very good so far. Amazon delivered the product within a day and the phone comes in premium packaging. I was really excited about the multimedia specifications on this device - 120Hz 10-bit Amoled and Harmon Kardon stereo speakers; And I must say that this device lives up to the hype.The overall build quality of the phone is also great.I have been able to take some amazing pictures and the performance of the 108 MP triple camera has been good so far. Coming to the buzz around the 120-watt charging- Yes! The phone really charges in less than 20 mins. A 120W charger is provided in the box itself.The Qualcomm snapdragon 888 is so powerful and super smooth I rarely see a loading screen. It takes time to get used to MIUI though the software experience is much better than what I was expecting based on social media feedback.All in all, it's a great package at this price point.

I got my phone a couple of days back and I am sharing my first impression.For all those who are wondering whether 120 Watt charging technology really makes adifference and whether the full charge in 17 mins claim by Xiaomi holds anything to it, let metell all of you guys my thoughts about this. Not sure about the 17 mins claim, but from mypersonal experience, It really charges the phone in less than 20mins. This chargingtechnology is really amazing and at a lot of times, I don’t have time in the morning to chargemy phone, but it brings the phone to a full day’s worth of charge (>50%), within first 5-6 mins,which is truly amazing.I really liked the camera on this device, especially the 108 MP primary camera and 5 MPmacro camera. This phone comes with a Samsung HM2 108 MP ultra-large size sensor andcoupled with SD 888 and Spectra 580 ISP, this camera setup is a beast. It takes ultra clearphotos during day-time and the night imagery is also surprisingly very sharp and noise-free.The 5 MP tele-macro sensor also captures amazing macro shots.I played BGMI on high settings and it performed great with no lags, something to expectfrom a flagship device of this price range for sure. The device performance is amazing and Ididn’t find any instances of heating up or so.Some third-party apps are already pre-installed on the phone but some of them such asPrime Video, Netflix, etc are utility apps which almost everybody installs these days, so I’mnot worried about them. And also, the rest of the apps can be uninstalled also, if you want,so that’s good too. Honestly, I feel that MIUI has really improved now and this new version ofMIUI is a very different experience compared to before.Last but not the least, Display. Display on this device is something really out of this world. Itcomes with a 120 HZ true 10-bit display which is really gorgeous to look at and it pumps outsome really sharp, crisp and clear content on the screen. It even comes with support forHDR 10+ and Dolby Vision. Coupled with the amazing sound setup this device comes with, itis the device to go for if you want to consume multimedia content on your mobile phone

I purchased this Xiaomi 11T Pro as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loved it. It has such a premium feel and the design is also amazing. It is packed with a plethora of features - ranging from 120W charging, true 10-bit display to a 108 MP camera array.I’m impressed by the charging times of this device. The 120W charger provided in the box is capable of fully charging it within 17 mins, and that’s just, fast. The 120 Hz AMOLED display is a treat to be watching videos and scrolling through social media apps. It even supports dolby vision and I’m truly amazed after researching that this feature is not available on any other device other than the iPhones. With the audio they have taken things to another levelby providing dual symmetrical stereo speakers tuned by Harman Kardon with a support for Dolby Atmos. With all this you can imagine how good the audio quality is on this one.My wife loves doing a bit of photography on her weekends and she is happy with the camera performance and especially that 5MP tele-macro camera, gets her amazing macro shots of various subjects. The camera setup is very satisfactory.It comes with 13 5G bands which I think makes the device future-proof and as soon as 5G networks are rolled out by the network providers, we’ll be able to use it.I would say, this is an amazing device whether you want it for yourself or to gift this to someone close to you.

Best Flagship Phone under 50000
","
I was really excited about this new flagship phone from Xiaomi considering I wanted to get a new device for myself and upgrade from my existing OP 6T. This was launching on the day of my birthday itself and since I really wanted to upgrade to this device since it comes with such amazing specs, I purchased this beast on the launch day itself. This device comes packed with a multitude of features.1. First of all, this device just looks so beautiful. I bought this in Celestial Magic color and honestly, the name justifies the beauty. It changes colors under the sunlight where you can see a multitude of colors at different angles. It comes with a Matt glass back, looks very premium, and also does not become a fingerprint magnet. Hence, giving me the freedom to be able to use it without any back cover. :)2. 120 W charging support: Supported by 120W charging for a 5000mAh big battery, I think this is one of the first phones to have this feature and one of the key features for which I decided to purchase this phone. The device charges in under 20 mins and provides for a full day’s worth of power with its large 5000 mAh battery. I was glad to know that Xiaomi inbuilt so many good safety features inside this charging setup to make this 120W charging a safe experience.3. It comes with one of the best processors according to me, the Snapdragon 888. It is a flagship processor and is even able to handle any of the modern games, high res videos and any of the other modern day tasks with pretty ease.4. The 108MP triple pro camera setup works really well, it also has 8MP Ultra-wide camera, 5MP macro camera. The ultra-wide camera is a letdown but I am truly amazed by the 5MP tele-macro camera. It reaches so close to its subjects and is able to click such detailed macro images. The night time photography is actually really amazing with this camera. The 16 MP selfie camera is nothing extraordinary but it is good and it gets the job done.5. One of my most favorite features is the display & audio quality. The phone comes with a 120 Hz AMOLED display, Dolby Vision & Dolby Atmos support and Harman Kardon speakers. It provides the best experience when watching or listening to anything. I watch a lot of movies & tv series on my mobile and the viewing experience on this phone has been the best that I have observed so far.The symmetrical stereo speakers on the phone provide an amazing music experience.6. It comes equipped with such cool and futuristic features such as NFC support, dual 5G sim support, etc. It also comes with 13 5g bands which is truly amazing considering 5G services are soon to be rolled out in India in an year or two and that makes this device a truly future-proof one.Overall if you ask me i think it is one of the best smartphones of the year and a truly amazing phone, and coupled with the introductory offers that I got with this phone, the absolutely best deal anyone could have gotten.

AN AMAZING PHONE. A MUST BUY!!!

I have been using the Xiaomi 11T pro for a week now. My experience with this deviceso far has been great & I have loved this device. It is an absolute must buy.I have played BGMI and COD mobile at the highest settings and haven’t observedany overheating and the gaming experience was totally smooth. Slight heating postsome prolonged gaming sessions is observed but that is normal for any flagshipprocessor of the times, and believe me, it is well within the expected range.The turbo game mode really helped get the maximum performance out of the device. Whilegaming I used wireless earphones and because of the latest audio codec supportthere was no latency as well. But the highlight for me has been the audio and thedisplay on this phone. The phone has dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos whichprovide a great acoustic experience.The 120 Hz 10-bit Amoled Panel on this device is a very bright and vivid display andthe 480 Hz TSR, really helped getting an edge over competition when you’re playingany of the multiplayer/FPS games or anything else, gives you a blazing fast responseand really helps make your gaming sessions amazing.I really like the 120W charging feature since a bigger battery and a 17 mins fastcharging is what I need to ensure that it charges in a jiffy and I’m able to have moregaming sessions on the phone.I haven’t been able to use the camera much but so far it looks good to me.The clean MIUI experience is an added bonus. One of the best OS out there.A MUST BUY!

First I was afraid that the camera is not as good as the previous predecessor but i was wrong ..""Mind blowing ,best in class camera setup"" .I promise you won't regret if you purchase this phone ..Here are my ratings:-1. Camera -9/102. Display - 10/103. Battery Backup- 9.5/104. Charging speed - 10/105. Speaker quality -10/106. Build quality- 10/107. Network - 9.5/108. Finger print/face unlock - 10/10Conclusion:1. Great display because of 120Hz amoled technology,HDR 10+ , Dolby vision Support.2. Great camera because of 108 mp and tons of video recording and photography options (can't differentiate between OIS and non OIS , trust me)(specially macro camera is awesome.)3. Battery because of very little heating while heavy usage , charging is super fast 25 min full.4. Music because of Harman Kardon tuned speaker, very loud and clear with little bass.Full LDAC support , Hi-res wireless and wired certification. Overall performance is awesome,(Definately because of Snapdragon 888 processor).Definitely you can buy. Thank you

The BEST PREMIUM Flagship Experience!
","
Pleasantly surprised with the experience on this device.Here are my impressions so far after having used it.1. The design is very premium and build quality is solid. I would highly recommend this celestial magic color. Literally feels like I'm using multiple photos at once. As you can see in the photos, the colors change dynamically. The matte finish back also gives good grip and no smudges or fingerprints.2. The audio experience is the best I've tried on any smartphone. Harman Kardon stereo speakers give true symmetrical audio on both sides. Great for watching content or songs. Music sounds so good on this and Dolby Atmos sounds great.3. Display is the best on any smartphone in India currently I think. 10 bit AMOLED + Dolby Vision + 480 Hz Touch Sampling and the overall experience is so smooth especially since 120Hz is well optimized in MIUI. Tried some content on Netflix and it looks amazing. Very vivid and bright, feels like I'm watching a TV. Very immersive experience especially with good audio.4. The battery life is great. I am a heavy user and I am getting over a day of use with ease. Best part is 120W charger in box. 100% in around 17 mins is crazy. I used to charge overnight but now I just plug in before going into shower or when making food. Also I compared it to my macbook 65W charger and its half the size despite having twice the output almost.5. The camera setup is great. Very natural portraits and low light performance is good due to Dual Native ISO. Especially loving the macro camera which myself and my son are using on every object around the house to see what we can capture. Have included a few shots for you to check out.6. Performance has been great so far thanks to the Snapdragon 888 chipset.Overall very happy with the experience so far.

Bought this phone on 25th January and using this for 6 days, Display and speaker sounds quality are unmatchable, for content viewing and entertainment this is the best phone.Camera is also very good as per as other flagships.I never expect this kind of smooth experience in MIUI, 120hrz display is buttery smooth, not facing a single issue in user experience. Work very fast and smooth, which was not available other MI / Redmi phones. I am not a gamer so can't comment on that. But I am fully satisfied with the performance.Again user experience is very improved and I can feel it while using this.

The Xiaomi 11T Pro is a great phone for any user. The 120W Xiaomi Hypercharge is perfect for people who can't wait to use their phone (my phone is fully charged in 20 minutes from 0 to 100), and the true 10-bit AMOLED display with HDR10+ with Dolby vision is perfect for those who love to watch videos. It has dual symmetrical stereo speaker system tuned by Harmon Kardon and support Dolby Atoms audio and Hi-res audio playback which is awesome for listening music. The 108MP primary camera with 8K recording support is great for taking photos and videos, and the 120-hertz display with snapdragon 888 processor with 8GB RAM +3GB virtual RAM is perfect for gaming.In my opinion Xiaomi 11t pro 5G is better than OnePlus 9RT 5G

 TBH, this is bang for the buck for this price range and easily beats so called other premium brands like, YOU KNOW THEM.Pros :* Display  (Dolby vision + 10 bit panel + 120hz refresh  rate, having them together is a bliss)* Finger print scanner  (Fast AF, BTW, I'm not a fan of In-Display finger print scanner)* Battery life  (you get One and half a day easily with  moderate+ usage)* Charging speed  (No, it doesn't charge fully in 17mins, but is  fastest in this segment for sure)* Gaming  (No heating issues even when played BGMI for  an hour, as SO called techies complain about  SD888)* User interface  (You heard it right, Miui is awesome in this  phone. No bugs or whatsoever as of now, and  it's the smoothest. If you know tweeking few  settings in MIUI, you get absolutely great UI)* Audio  (Be it earphones, type c dongle-of course, loud  speaker, the audio quality is awesome. Oh my  HARMAN KARDON! )* IR Blaster  (Always a useful feature)CONS :* Camera  (Not at all good, period.)* Promised updates  (They said 3+4 years of Android and security  patches respectively, and the phone comes  out of the box with Android 11, so that they  can skip Android 15. Safe play, Xiaomi?)* Proximity Sensor  (Xiaomi seriously forgot the basics. I sold  Xiaomi 11 lite ne 5g for the same reason and  the same issue is here in this phone too. While  you're on a call, the screen doesn't turn off  when needed and doesn't turn on when  needed. Listening, Xiaomi?)Conclusion :Turn off useless notifications, uninstall useless apps, set app drawer as preferred home screen, get a simple round icon pack, HOLA! Lightest UI is ready (attaching video), and you won't get another phone around this price bracket in this price range.

Almost I researched one month to buy a flagship phone in budget price. Finally I chose xiaomi 11T pro. I purchased 12GB + 256GB version in just Rs 27700 after exchanging of poco x2. Original price was Rs 41999, I got amazing exchange price of 11800, Rs 1000 of coupon and Rs 1500 cash back on icici amazon pay card. This is the best of the best deal. Most features I liked are1. Metal frame (Samsung is giving  cheap plastic in 50k plus phones)2. Corning gorilla victus screen which again you can not find in similar priced phones of other brands. 6.7 inch screen size which is bigger than phones I made a list while doing research.3. Excellent Amoled screen and high sunlight visibility4. Excellent battery backup that you can't find even in one lakh priced phones. I am moderat user and coming home in the evening with 60% battery. 1.5 days  can be managed by any normal person with normal usage5. Full charge in 25 minutes again u can't find in any Samsung or apple phones6. Very fast screen and butter smooth operation7. Excellent camera quality with so many mods and fun editing. Camera is better than Samsung note 20 which is being used by my neighbor.8. So many shortcuts (watch video on 40 plus tricks with xiaomi 11t pro)My research is not wrong. And this phone is going to get Android 13 and 14. After purchase immediately I got 12 update.

Great compromise

My first impressions with the phone, it's obviously not laggy or gittery at all, very smooth especially with 120Hz enabled. The screen is pretty good, i find the sRGB mode the most comfortable setting for my eyes, but I'm still testing.The 150W charging is unreal. Coming from a phone that charged at 10W and had the same battery capacity, the speed feels wrong (17min for 100%), but no issues with it yet. Battery life however, will vary based on usage and if you want to pull the most out of it, you're gonna wanna keep the display at 60Hz most of the time (This is not a variable refresh rate display, it can only do 60 or 120) and keep stuff like Bluetooth and NFC off when you're not using it. The battery life seems disappointing, but given that my previous phone also had a 5000mah battery and comparatively less power hungry display and processor, it seems fair, and by just keeping the screen at 60Hz and your radios off when you're not using them, you can get 1-1.5 days easy.Performance-wise, people have complained about over heating, but that hasn't been the case for me. Cranking CODM at 120Hz has been a great experience with a lack of heat spots on the display. However, your mileage may vary as for those of you that so not know, there is a thing called the silicon lottery.Camera is workable, but not something a photographer would use, initial impressions are sad... 108mp is just a number, and the photos look very grainy under artificial light, haven't tested it completely though.UI is fairly customisable, the Xiaomi layout is present, but you can opt for a more conventional layout as well. My personal setting is Nova launcher + gesture navigation, but that is not possible here, so am getting used to the navigation buttons again. Not a huge irritation point, but small things that can make it feel perfect.Finger print sensor is good, works well out of the box, no issues whatsoever, except that sometimes I miss looking at my lockscreen...IR blaster works but feels a bit weaker than the older Xiaomi smartphones, but that is something that can be affected by the case as well maybe, so i reserve final judgement on that, but the Xiaomi remote app has become much better, supporting more devices. Still, i use Sure because it's the best.Speakers are very nice, much better than any single speaker setup and very loud and clear. While it doesn't have an audio jack, sound quality off the USB C port is pretty ok, leagues better than your typical Xiaomi phone bout 5 years ago. Although, the USB C to Audio Jack adapter in box is a little too thin for my taste.Overall first impressions a lot more positive than i expected, Xiaomi has ironed out a lot of problems they used to have and small small things here and there make the phone feel fun, like the animation on the battery screen, that responds to you shaking or tilting your phone. I have had buyer's remorse with other phones i have purchased, not with this one. (Not yet at least)

The Best Flagship your money can buy!

Before buying a phone I look into the 4 pillars of a smartphone and those are Display, camera, battery, and Internals.Coming to Display- Xiaomi 11T Pro just nailed it. Best in class super AMOLED display with all the HDR support and a true 10 bit. The speakers on the phone are also a bonus point as they are really crisp and are tuned by Harmon Kardon.Next is the Camera- Xiaomi 11T Pro has an amazing set of cameras. The 108MP main camera is good takes some great photos in daylight and thanks to dual native ISO low light is also good. The best in the set 5 MP telemacro camera which takes a beautiful macro shot in any price range.Coming to the Hypercharged Part or battery- Once you use it there no going back. The 120Watt charger in the box is really fast as it takes less than 20 mins to get to full. Battery life also lasts for a full day in my usage.Last but not the least Internals: Top of the line processor…. Check. Fastest RAM and Storage…… Check. All the sensors and some more like the IR blaster….Check. IP rating….Check. Gorilla Glass Victus……Check…Great Build also…..Check.So I will recommend buying it and plus at a great price also.

Excellent phone, switching from oneplus used for 6 years, it was a tough descision, but absolutely worth it.. extremely Lovable phone for price rangeCamera, display, snapdragon 888, refresh ratez speakers battrey life and OFCOUSE CHARGING SPEED.. all is tooo tooo goood.Certain issues..1) in-pocket proximity sensor and sometimes on call sensor2) no direct dial widget3) led indicator missing4) fewer widget options, one of my personal favourite mssing . Direct dial.But all are minor setbacks.

After using it for over a week, here is my first impression.Display: Great! One USP of this phone is the display used on this device. They used an excellent AMOLED panel which provides great viewing experience.Battery and charging: The 120w charger charges the phone quickly. Although it doesn't charge the device in 17 minutes, battery gets charged in 20-25minutes. Probably turning off mobile data/WiFi or turning on aeroplane mode might increase charging speed.With my mixed usage that includes YouTube, Spotify and WhatsApp the phone delivers 6+ hours of SOT. Also mobile data and wifi were always on.Camera: although not tested it much, few shots which I took using this phone came out beautiful. It also takes decent photos at night. One negative is lack of OIS. Those capture alot of videos might miss OIS. Otherwise a great camera.speakers: Stereo speakers  tuned by Harman kardon delivers great sound. It's loud, clear and crisp. You will definitely love these speakers.Verdict: It's obviously a value for money device. You get a device with  great display, excellent speakers and super fast charging speed and good camera. If youre someone who consumes alot of media, this is the best phone for you.

Hypercharge never does it jobs, first 2 days battery gets charged within 25 mins @ hypercharge after few days it's not getting charged within the specified time by xiaomi, it takes around 40+ mins for charging. 108 MP camera is of no use, photos looks over sharpened and video is okay. Overall it's not worth for the money we putforth in it. Only positive things are the display unit. Heats up very soon during usage and when u shoot on 4k . An average product from xiaomi. Dolby Atmos Sound u will never experience in it. Dolby vision and HDR looks same no difference. Sound on its speakers are decent enough but not for the money you invest.

So much hype for this phone. But it is not good at all. I was using honor 8 pro earlier, Thought of buying a good camera phone earlier to my family with other basic features are in place. But after buying this phone i really disappointed. where to start - everything i feel cheep and cheated. After paying 37500 i was not expecting this type of phone.Camera - Bad, just hype 108 MP, compare to my previous phone my honor 8 pro real camera it is nothingBattery - it does charges fast and it drain outs very fast too in the normal usage.performance - It is just OKLooks and feel - Cheep, lot of UI you wont like at allSound: only sound is better or loud, but you wont like it alwaysHeating issues - it heated after using camera or gamingOverall - I will just give one star due to this price range and quality. advise to everybody - please don't be fool like me. never ever buy any new launch smartphone till others convinced .Atleast you get convinced after seeing the phone physically. Otherwise you will feel bad like me after spending lot of money for nothing.

PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS XIAOMI MODEL. There is problem with proximity sensor. The screen during call gets on and than randomly the call will be put on hold or it goes in speaker mode or will open another app or will dial another no. I faced proximity sensor issue with first phone that was delivered, after compliant it was replaced, but the second phone also has same issue of malfunction of proximity sensor.  Paying such premium price for this phone is like letting had earned money go down the drain.

Fabulous Phone In Mi

I will not write a very long review for this device but I’ll just say that this is a totally amazing product and I am very satisfied with the phone and the deal I get with this one. I bought it during the sale event with a 5000 rupees off with my SBI card. I bought the 256GB phone in celestial magic color and it just looks so freaking awesome.Pros:-This phone is truly a flagship device. It has all that one needs in it. An ultra-fast Snapdragon 888 processor, a 108 MP camera setup and a 5000 mAh battery with that.I really liked the 120W charging support on this. CHarging is really fast on this device and I’m able to fully juice it up within 20 mins.It comes with a 120 Hz Amoled display which is a really bright and punchy display.The speaker setup on this one is provided by Harman Kardon. It also comes with support for Dolby vision and high-res certification. It is really loud and clear and I must say, I haven’t heard such an amazing audio setup for a long time now.Cons:- Phone heats up a little when I play BGMI, especially on highest settings with 90 fps but it also cools down pretty rapidly.Hope Xiaomi fixes this, otherwise this is an Excellent device

Hyper Discharging Battery, Poor camera, gets hung. Amazon didn't refund full amount.
","
Not only Hypercharging, but Hyperdischarging as well. Battery drains really quick.What to talk about charging time, it's being advertised as 17 minutes from 0 to 100%. But in actual it takes more than 33-35 minutes.Camera quality is also not upto the mark.Surprisingly phone started getting hung in 3rd day itself, that too when no app load or no game was installed even.To add this, Amazon is fooling the customers by cheating them by sending faulty products and without refunding committed amount back.On returning the faulty phone, they refunded 5000 Rs less mentioning old phone's value was including promotional offer. While before rasing the request, they told full amount will be refunded.This is il-practice they follow. While invoice says full amount has been refunded.At the end I lost both new phone (faulty product sold by Amazon), my old fully functional phone (lost to Amazon Exchange offer, which they aren't returning), incomplete Refund amount and Unexplainable Problems I am facing currently without my phone.Really feel Cheated.!!

Skip this so called flagship. Note 10 pro is better than this

Too many cons for this price.Software is half baked and buggy.No OIS in video recording,throttling issue with flagship cpu,no ip68 rating,no headphone jack even with this size and weight of the phone( this phone doesn't have a slim profile),proximity sensor issue during calls,WhatsApp audio message causing screen to go blank,Camera is not able to start most of the time. Battery drainage is like a free fall once charged within 35 mins and not claimed 17 mins.issues with Google dialer getting stuck,Video toolbox special feature doesn't work, display flicker is prominent forcing one to enable anti flicker mode which switches display to just 60hz negatiing all hype of 120 hz refresh rate,ai image enhancement features are gimmicks, back tap gestures like double back tap doesn't work consistently,gets noticeably hot with temperature around 42 degree Celsius even with throttling. no software updates to fix these issues yet.Previous phone note 10 pro Max was far better than this so called hyperphone.Don't waste money on this. Xiaomi is better in mid range. Flagship is uncharted territory for them. Software experience is better in Xiaomi midrange than this one. Not sure why 12 gb ram 256 gb rom ufs 3.1 device with lpddr5 ram feels inferior in daily usage compared to a 17,000 rupee phone from same company.

Posting review after 2 months of use.MIUI Sucks, Xiaomi feels it knows best and as a result even basic software android functions that have been there for years are not present on this phone due to MIUI.Xiaomi throttles the SOC so hard even under regular non taxing use that its performance is same as a SD865. The X1 prime core lays dormant most of the time regardless of performance mode selected in the menu and when it activated it barely cracks 2.15GHz. There is an Anandtech article on this Xiaomi throttling, you can look it up or just open any cpu monitor in the mini display.General UI is smooth enough to navigate but the settings are convoluted and the whole heavy handed MIUI feel is off putting. Web browsing is not SD 888 snappy and apps open/load times are never consistent.Split control center copied from Apple is stupid and the regular one has old graphics which is UGLY.Twitter and Spotify are a jank fest, what 120Hz?Real difficulty in changing default apps.Also phone stays locked at 120Hz in every video app except Netflix & Prime. Any other video app like Hotstar, Discovery + or Z5 stay locked at 120 and do no trigger 60Hz to save battery life. This behavior is there for any video content. Vanced also does not trigger 60Hz. Both Oxygen OS 10 & Color OS trigger 60Hz for full screen video content regardless of app but MIUI does not as a result battery life suffers.Phone heats up instantly the moment its hit with any decent workload and performance drops significantly.The Dolby Vision thing is nice on paper but my 7T Pro gets much higher bitrate stream from Netflix which is significantly more detailed than the 11T Pro even though both have same Full HD playback specification on paper.Screen does get bright, but it does suffer from severe off axis color shift even under slight angles. All oleds have some color shifting but this is severe in my book. Screen does not get dim enough for late night use.Camera is decent, I’m not that much into camera performance so I can’t comment much on it but overall camera is decent.I thought I would like the side mounted fp reader but after 3 years of in display reader it feels like a step back in terms of ergonomics for me. You might feel different but I don't really like the side placement. Unlock speed is not an issue its the side placement.There are so many little things that are annoying that makes this phone hard to recommend.

Xiomi India is bundling so much features in their smartphones which is good at that price perspective but they're ignoring the crucial thing in their phones is ""calibration"". This phone is not that bad in terms of display and sound but leave that aside and there're lots of bugs in overall functionality of many features. On a flagship level camera clarity doesn't match to many others at same price point. Zoom in the pics and you'll see details like it's a crayons sketch. Battery life is ok but charging takes about 35 to 45 minutes to fully charge which is more than double time of what they claim. I've used Xiaomi note 5 pro for 3.5 years without any flaws exept wear and tear of charging port & vibration motor which is very much acceptable. Now I bought 3 phones of Xiaomi and all are replaced and refunded, not because of hardware but for those bugs in UI and lack of calibration in one or other features they provide. It's high time for Xiaomi to get rid of this ASAP, else they'll loose their reputation of providing value for money specs and also customer base.One annoyed consumer. (Fan priorly)

I bought this phone with exchange on 8 Feb,2022 for 35k (8gb+256gb) and i am reviewing it on 16 April,2022 so i have descent amount of usage.I bought this phone mainly for media consumption because of the 10 bit display (i am a Heavy media consumer) and i have not been disappointed, beautiful display and vivid colours.(4.5/5) for display.After display one thing that surprised me most is the music experience. Trust me bro hands down the best music experience i ever had. The in ear music experience is something else. While the speakers are mind blowing.If you own this phone I want you to do this, hold your phone completely horizontal with screen facing you and hold it close to your face at eye level. Once you do this find your favourite song and play it on full volume, switch the screen off and let the magic happen. That's Harman/kardon designed speakers for you my friend.For those who don't own this device let me tell you what happens, while the music is playing close to you it feels like the singer is sitting in the room and the clearity in his/her voice will kill you (metaphorically) and pure biss my friend. (5/5) for music only section to score full pointsComing to camera, well it's a fairly average camera for photos and pictures (and if you apply multiple filters and other things at the same time it will literally die😂😂), you will still get amazing pictures in natural and fully lit environment. (3/5) for pictures.Now when it comes to video recording it is totally different ball game, Man the video recorded are so good that i think it's one of the best if not the best in this price segment. Multiple options for recording. (Solid 4/5) for video recording.Now coming to battery life, this is the section where I have seen most of you complain and lemme tell you that you people have fallen into a trap of Hypercharge😂😂. Those of you who have used the 120w charger have destroyed their phone's battery life forever. The phone charges pretty fast but also drains pretty fast. So to tackle this issue I did not use the 120w charger not even once. As you can see in one of the pics, I use 15w charger of my note 5 pro for charging 😂😂 this phone and it charges my phone in 90 mins. Result: Solid one and a half day of battery life. That is why I said if you use correctly in title. (4/5)for battery if used correctly.Coming to ui, it still has some bugs but still manageable.(3.5/5) for the UI.One more thing, when i bought this phone my friend simultaneously bought iPhone 12. I compared every aspect of this phone to iPhone 12 and this phone beats the iPhone 12 in antutu score, geekbench. This phone is superior to iPhone 12 in every aspect except the camera section. He bought the iPhone 12 for 58k with exchange😂😂. No need to say sad boi. Paid 20k extra for brand value and camera.This phone even has 3 years of security updates, that's a plus.Overall (4/5) for this phone. Don't fall for 120w charger, it is just a Marketing gimmick and will kill your battery life.

1. Battery-  About 10 to 12 hours with often usage including calling and multimedia use. Don't use the phone on balanced mode, use performance mode. It's heats less and battery life is better. Strange but no idea. Fact.2. Performance -It's very fast. Even in weak networks it performs good.3. Camera- Punchy and sharp. Will make you beautiful✨✨4. Formfactor - it's easy to hold even in cover and well balanced. Not bulky.5. Unique points- Charging time is 20 mins. If phone is hot Or outside temparature is more it can need 30-35 mins also. Viewing movies is very good on this sreeen. Last but not least the Harmon Kardon speakers. It's provides good loud sound. Pair with your other blue tooth devices in home or car and it sounds great.

This review is after 3weeks of usage of Xiaomi 11T pro.I switched to this phone from oneplus 7 so I had lot of apprehensions before purchasing it on the first day of its release. But I must say this phone has pleasantly surprised me on almost all aspects. Its a very balanced phone at this pricepoint.Performance:- The performance is awsome though while playing heavy games it does heatup after 15-20 mins. However, it runs cooler for day to day usage. It buttery smooth and there is no struttering or hangups. 120hz refresh rate is icing on the cake.Battery:- It easily lasts 36 hrs for me and I am a heavy user and spend a lot of time (about 6-7hrs daily) on multimedia, social media, calls etc. The best part is the super fast charger, which quickly charges from 50% to 100% in about 10-12 mins.Camera:- Though the image quality from camers is a subjective matter, I found the camera to be of above average quality. The color production is near to real objects color, though the human subjects might appear slightly whitish tone. Able to capture contrasting image really well. Video quality is decent too. The closeup photos (using the super macro feature) of objects are mindblowing.Sound and Display:- The stereo speakers are loud and well tuned and sound output is great.The display is the best part on this phone. In my earlier phone while watching Netflix contents, the picture quality was dark for 4k HDR contents but this phone really renders awsome picture quality.Software:- This is the first time I am using MIUI operating System as for last 6 years I have been using Oxygen OS but must say that MIUI is very stable though it comes with few bloatwares and most of which can be uninstalled.Like any other phone, this phone also has some downsides. Like the build quality is average, if I compare with my OnePlus 7 phone. There is no OIS so need to keep my hands steady while capturing photos/videos. It has sidemounted fingerprint scanner while I had in-display fringerprint scanner on my OnePlus. Also, it comes with Android 11 and Not Android 12 out of the box.

I was looking to upgrade from my previous Oneplus 7T and was looking to purchase another flagship phone. I decided on purchasing the Xiaomi 11T Pro for the features it offers at a great price (additionally I was also able to claim the introductory offers which provided for a steal deal).The build quality of the device looks amazing & the back panel finish looks super premium. Some of the other features which really impressed me were:1) Display quality - the display panel on this phone is one of the best that I have seen so far. With a refresh rate of 120Hz the amoled panel looks very vibrant and bright. The technology that they have used  is said to be able to reproduce over 1 billion colors. The content viewing experience on this device is outworldly.2) Snapdragon 888 & fast charging - phone comes with a 120W charging brick which can charge the phone in boost mode & able to charge in just a few mins. Xiaomi hasn’t compromised on the battery capacity when providing fast charging support and the device comes with a 5000 mah battery. The powerful processor i.e. snapdragon 888 is able to support even the most demanding games. Then there is liquid cooling technology to ensure that the heating is minimised.

 Okay so this review is gonna be the overall process of purchasing and returing my phone along with the phone review.The phone is amazing, the camera is by far the best in this price segment and Xiaomi did a really good job by optimising the software experience.I had no issues while playing BGMI and Genshin Impact on this phone. The phone did get a bit warm but that is common with snapdragon 888 chipset.The display is gorgeous. You cannot only watch HDR videos but can also record them. The proximity sensor worked fine for me. Overall the phone is definitely a buy.Now the problem with my unit was that the screen had vertical grey lines when viewing it at the light background. It might have been some manufacturing defect or could have been a shipping handling problem. After hours of calling the amazon customer care, countless tries to convince the technical agent that the display is faulty and 10 days later, amazon offered me a refund and not the replacement. In this process I lost my exchange bonus but I get it, it was never mine.Anyways this issue should be corrected by amazon and if the device is faulty, it should be replaced asap. For this service I have reduced 1 star from this review.

Good phone.....Pros- super fast charging, great chip, true duel firing speakers, amazing display,above average flagship camera, multimedia beast, companies attempt to be market king eg- providing everything in the box including 120w charger, case and even a freaking 3.5mm jack to c converter, great earpiece sound, infrared able, great os miui 12.5 out of the box, all u could ask forCons- it's actually nitpicking, soc gets hot after AGGRESSIVE gaming, just above average camera compared to a flagship phone camera especially on which 108mp is marked as a hunting trophy,like all versions miui 12.5 have soo much junk half removable half annoying presences, even though it charges 90% in 15 mins it drains battery slightly more compared to my old note 10 pro Series, at this price side mounted fingerprint sensor is bad choice,But I love my phone,my multimedia beast

I have got this device in the Celestial Magic color and I’m totally astonished by how beautiful it looks, even better than how it looks on the website. My experience so far with this device has been amazing:  It comes with a 108 MP main camera which performs very well. Coupled with the power of SD 888 and presence of a good ISP and a very large sensor, this camera setup is able to output some very good content. It comes comes with so many creative modes inbuilt such as Vlog, Night trails, Parallel world, etc. The 16 MP selfie camera is pretty standard but is able to click some very decent shots.It comes with an amazing AMOLED display with support for both HDR 10+ and Dolby vision so you enjoy all the great quality high res content present out there. I’ve been watching some of the Dolby titles (6 Underground, Extraction, etc) on Netflix using this one and the experience has been amazing. It even comes with a 10-bit display which outputs some really amazing and bright colors. It is able to show 1Bn+ colors and I just love this phone. Coming to the speaker setup, this is a really good speaker setup, tuned by Harman kardon to really amazing levels. The sound quality, stereo effect and loudness are very good. I think one of the biggest highlights on this device is the 120W charging setup which gives you best on the go charging. It is able to fully charge the device within 17 mins. Presence of upto 256 GB internal storage on the device is amazing since I need a lot of space to keep all that high res video content on the device. One last thing which I liked is its build and color, it has gorilla glass victus protection which is the toughest level of protection out there.

Overall Awesome

Xiaomi really mean business when they say that the Hypercharge revolution is on. Yes I am speaking about the newly launched phone Xiaomi 11T Pro. So I got this phone a week ago and I have been in love with it already. This is a phone that I believe is set to make a statement of itself, a phone that is here to stand the test of time.Coming with 13 5g bands and 3 years of software update, here what I see is a pre emptive attack on the future. The phone further comes with a battalion of amazing features, what really impressed me the most was the amazingly quick charging technology that fully charges up your phone in 17 mins as the company gurantees. Then comes the 10 bit AMOLED display, combined with Dolby vision, Harmon Kardon speakers and dolby atmos which when put together gives a really immersive audio and visual experience. The Camera quality of the device is also great which comes with the 8MP ultra wide camera and 5MP Macro Camera. Performance wise also the phone has got the Snapdragon 888, a real beast. The MIUI is even better sans the ads.

Very Good

The phone is  Top Notch in all aspects, SD 888 is super fast/ HDR+Dolpy vision display is a treat for the Eyes. Harmon/harden stereo speaker is fantastic.120 Watt Fast Charger is Awesome. 108 Mp&  Super macro Cameras are really good. Liked the Build Quality& Celestial Blue color very much.  Only the drawback is the side-mounted finger Print& Feel Warm Sometimes after an hour of usage, those  Can be ignored because it has lots of other features bundled with it.  Without second thought one should definitely go for this PhoneAfter lots of comparison of this segment  finally, I chose this Xiaomi 11T Pro & its worth it

You'll go in awe with the phone

Amazing, Amazing Amazing camera if you know how to use it. I've attached some camera samples to show what's it capable of. Now mind it, it was captured in raw format and then edited to the final result.Overall a great phone with amazing display, sound and camera again if you know how to use to it's full potential.The delivery could have been better. They dispatched the phone after a week of placing the order but I don't blame them maybe because I know there was a shortage of White colour.Overall satisfied!

Battery Backup Not Upto the Mark
","
One would expect to get atleast a day and a half's battery without any gaming, without prolonged use of audio and video facilities, at 60 Hz refresh rate, but alas, it disappoints to say the least. With MiUi 12.5 the battery drain is pathetic. With 13, a bit better. Charger lives up to it's name. 0-100% in 20 minutes in switched off mode. Camera quality decent. Night photography decent but not of flagship level. Display truly beautiful. Speed and performance very good. However both battery issues and performance quality can be optimised with software updates.Note: This dual cell battery technology is not detected by some leading battery health monitoring apps. So essentially they will detect your battery capacity to be 5000 mAh, but charging and battery health will shown as 2500 mAh. Also the overall voltage is shown to be around 7.4+ V which is also a bit strange.

A best choice

This is my first Xiaomi phone which I have purchased till date. I have been in One plus ecosystem for a long time and now, owing to the problems that I have been facing with my last device for some time, a degrading UI, I decided to buy this Xiaomi 11T Pro as my new device and would I know that I was making the best decision while buying this device.It is a great product at this price point and whether you look at display, battery or charging performance, wherever you look, it stands so much farther than its peers in the range.The 120W charger shipped in the box with the device is amazing and charges up the device in very time. At times, I don’t even realize and the device is fully charged up. It does tend to heat up a bit during the boost charging, but that is to be expected when you’re passing such high currents to the battery. Nothing to be worried about.Coming next to the MIUI experience. Honestly, it is much better than what I had heard about from my friends. Coming from Oxygen OS, it is totally a different experience. The UI comes with a lot of features and I really liked the fact that almost all of the in-built and system apps on this are removable. You can totally customize the UI to your liking and it has been an amazing experience so far.The device does come with a 10-bit Amoled display and a symmetrical stereo speaker setup tuned by Harman-Kardon which just makes this device breathtaking and sets it apart from its peer devices. I’d say these are the top two reasons for me to buy this device.In fact I’d say, this is a flagship device in the true sense possible. It does come with SD 888 processor which might be a bit old now but is the latest flagship processor that you can find in India. This is a totally flagship level product and I am happy with the move I make with this purchase.

Everything was impressive except picture quality.

The feature which I liked the most is its Harman/Kardon speaker, the sound is really awesome and very clear. Second thing is it's 120W charging which can fully charge your phone between 22 to 25 mins. And the other features which I like is it's Amoled 10 bit display and it's processor 888 but i found lack of graphic processing in it. Overall the camera is good not great but i can understand that in that budget you can't provide everything and I'm happy in this mighty package of features in this price. Glad to have this device...love it.
